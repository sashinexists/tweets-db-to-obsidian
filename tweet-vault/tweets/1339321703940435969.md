@VC31415 @yudapearl @PhilHaile Wright is an example where some features of a model are identified and others not. Perhaps the first actual example of set identification is Frisch (1934) - provides explicit bounds on a coefficient. I think this is an example of an ID problem for which PO and DAG are not useful.
