@stephensenn @f2harrell @smueller @ChristosArgyrop @soboleffspaces @AndrewPGrieve @PavlosMsaouel Claims about differences between women and men were made in the Garden of Eden, way before statisticians began noticing them. My claims are not about men and women but about combining RCT with observational studies. Any reference to such analysis by a statistician? Very curious!!
