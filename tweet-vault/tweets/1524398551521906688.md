@TacoCohen @yudapearl @JorisMooij @eliasbareinboim @bschoelkopf @carlorovelli @seanmcarroll I would consider causality a relation between random variables (e.g. smoking causes cancer), so in that sense pixels can be "causal". On the other hand, in causal representation learning, "causal variable" seems to mean "a variable that is part of the underlying causal system".
