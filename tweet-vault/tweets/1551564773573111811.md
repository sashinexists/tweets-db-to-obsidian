@artistexyz @maxkasy @HarvardEcon It's worse than geometry without figures. We can do geometry without geometrical figures because our assumption are defensible (eg. Euclide's axioms). In Potential Outcomes, the assumptions are conditional ignorability assertions, the plausibility of which humans cannot judge.
