@yudapearl @steventberry @lewbel @causalinf @PHuenermund @econbookclub @Chris_Auld @analisereal @jdramirezc I think we do agree on most substance and that the substantial confusion in econ hurts research and communication. I think you've seen my attempt to clarify (within the broader Cowles tradition) here https://t.co/A5M2lkCr4v but I'd support our students' reading your stuff too.
