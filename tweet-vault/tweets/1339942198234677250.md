@neilpearce53x @Yqzhong7 @PWGTennant We also managed to build Gothic cathedrals before the science of forces &amp; beams came along. I cannot agree that "drawing a DAG is a formality". When you have several sets of covariates and you are trying to pick the best (in terms of power and cost) DAGs are indispensable.
