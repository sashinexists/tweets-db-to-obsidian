@MeganTStevenson @instrumenthull @PHuenermund @paulgp @dlmillimet @pietrobiroli @eliasbareinboim @josh_t_dean @uhlily Lily Hu's paper is unique in trying to bridge between those claiming: "this is NOT the 'true social meaning' of discrimination" and those trying to capture, be it formally or conceptually, what this "true social meaning" is all about.
