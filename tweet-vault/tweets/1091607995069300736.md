My college route was from Rutgers to Brooklyn Poly, but I only took it three times:
1.Written exam, 2.Oral exam. 3.Thesis defense. Classes were boring. I publically confessed, and apologized for this unruly behavior in a commencement speech at Toronto: https://t.co/9CDh6uqEQn https://t.co/Aondk9kT3R
