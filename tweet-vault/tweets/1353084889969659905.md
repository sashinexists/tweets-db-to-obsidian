I've skimmed Heckman and Pinto (2013)  paper, where they introduce "Haavelmo" fix operator (do's descendant). For simple interventions (ATE) do and fix are equivalent. For counterfactuals (ATE Treated), fix can be used in queries E [Y | X: fix(X = \til X)]. Similar to SWIGs. https://t.co/QARP0CuwMg
