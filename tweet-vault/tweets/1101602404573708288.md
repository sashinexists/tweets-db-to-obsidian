@shakir_za @blei_lab @fhuszar I am glad you mentioned my "half Bayesian" paper https://t.co/gqeQb23En9 which makes me more convinced in "halfness" each time I read it. I wish I could get serious feedback from the "full Bayesians", but they are busy waiting for their posteriors to peak on the truth.#Bookofwhy
