@yudapearl @eliasbareinboim @EpiEllie @iwashyna @Amy_Bohnert @Research_ICU @NEJM @_MiguelHernan Ok I think I see your point about covariate-specific effect. I imagine that most data sets &amp; causal questions have a sub-population in mind, so thinking through the target trial would most likely lead to an estimate of a covariate (e.g. sub-population)-specific effect.
