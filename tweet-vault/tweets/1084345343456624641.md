@omaclaren @eliasbareinboim @statwonk @PHuenermund Gelman's statement: "Statisticians use models all the time, statistics textbooks are full of models" is plain wrong --I just examined all stat textbooks on my shelf. We could perhaps excuse engineering/physics books that estimate parameters in systems of equations of known form.
