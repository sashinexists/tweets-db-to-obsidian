@soboleffspaces @jmwooldridge @JohanDH2O @steventberry @stephensenn I think @jmwooldridge had a valid point. He who hasn't seen econometrics confusion over SEM (in 1970-80) would fail to understand the zealotry with which PO folks resisted SEM's comeback (in the 2000-10) to offer a scientific basis for PO and ways to circumvent its weaknesses.
