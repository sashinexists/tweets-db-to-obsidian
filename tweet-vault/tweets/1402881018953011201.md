Great show on @KennedyNation and a precise description of what @Sethrogen represents: The ignorant who blame their teachers for lying to them, so they can score acceptance points in  Zionophobic circles. Expect the Al Jazeera squad to bully you for going on Fox, instead of CNN. https://t.co/wy5Uf3viuN
