@analisereal @yudapearl @PACESconsulting @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @Jabaluck @HeerJeet @eliasbareinboim I'm sorry, you can't just dismiss the problem of modeling as "just an applied model"

It is *surely* important to be able to analyze any given model efficiently. Economists and others will benefit from those tools. No question
