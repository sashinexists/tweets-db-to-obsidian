@epi_viborg @evpatora Joking aside, I think you will find these two introductions to counterfactuals helpful in your PhD research: https://t.co/00HvGLZ9oq, and https://t.co/gNBNP7HuWZ. If you are into #causalinference, you should also find them easy and intellectually challenging. Goodluck. #Bookofwhy
