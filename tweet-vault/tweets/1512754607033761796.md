@soboleffspaces @analisereal Good question! The answer is NO: In obs. studies, adjusting for Z won't give you ACE. But if you have an RCT, then averaging over the
z-specific causal effects would give you ACE.
Proof:
E(Y|do(x)) = SUM_z  E(Y|do(x),z)P(z|do(x))=
SUM_z E(Y|do(x),z)P(z) if X doesn't affect Z.
