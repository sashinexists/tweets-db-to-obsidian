@eliasbareinboim @saramagliacane @yudapearl @JorisMooij @bschoelkopf @carlorovelli @seanmcarroll @FrancescoLocat8 @rosemary_ke These are very interesting papers, but my question can be asked even in a single domain. Imagine a robot that only has a camera, and basic actions. How can it figure out that there exist lights and switches (causal vars) and pressing the switch causes the light to go on?
