Previous chapters looked at causation from the outside, but people are causal agents: we can decide to do things and make them happen. 

As causal agents, maybe we *can* directly sense at least some causation. For ex, when we lift something heavy we sense &amp; respond to weight. https://t.co/hgAi92JyT5
