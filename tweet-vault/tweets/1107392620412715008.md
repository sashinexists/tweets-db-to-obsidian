@eliasbareinboim @autoregress @yudapearl @CarterPaddy Your "logic" is nothing more than an insulting analogy that presupposes that understanding your work is as foundational for doing causal inference as understanding multiplication is to doing mathematics. This is precisely what I dispute. To show this, GIVE REAL WORLD EXAMPLES.
