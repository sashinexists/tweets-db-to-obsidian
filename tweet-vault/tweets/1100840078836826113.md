@ConiByera @stephensenn @deaneckles You hit it on the nail. Lord Paradox is paradoxical in finite as well as infinite populations. It was introduced in the latter form, and has challenged statisticians in that form. I do not see what insights can be gained by introducing finite sample complications. #Bookofwhy
