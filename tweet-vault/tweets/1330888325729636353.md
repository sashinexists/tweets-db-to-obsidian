@thefeministcop @zeemo_n @Shade_Nox @EinatWilf When a group of people has right to self determination and their neighbors prevent them from realizing that right, attack them, &amp; promise to attack them again if strong enough, the group naturally defends itself and tries to prevent the attacker from repeating. No ethnicity here.
