@alexdamour @yudapearl @CsabaSzepesvari @mendel_random 2/4 I would say that itâ€™s an ill-conceived statement, in many (many) dimensions.  DAG models help to solve, in an organic fashion, the two issues raised implicitly: testability (when testable) and transparency of the assumptions (also, when not testable).
