@RonKenett @stephensenn If statisticians have been using the word "confounding" in other meanings, different from Eq. (1), I will qualify my statement. But sticking to Eq. (1), I maintain: Confounding is not a statistical notion. And please note, I define things explicitly and unambiguously. #Bookofwhy
