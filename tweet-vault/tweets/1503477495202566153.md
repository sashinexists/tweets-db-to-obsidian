@artistexyz @soboleffspaces @yudapearl @AndrewPGrieve @suiss70 @miquelporta @f2harrell If PNS is likely to help us cure more patients than CATE, we should switch to PNS on moral grounds. I am still not sure thatâ€™s the case, my main concern is that PNS apparently requires mixing observational and experimental data. It seems that confounding "helps" PNS - does it?
