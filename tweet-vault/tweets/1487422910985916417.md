@yudapearl @jeremycorbyn Though even if he had devoted his life to demonising Israel, it's just a country, there are many who have devoted time to demonising Russia, China &amp; others. Being critical of a nation &amp; its government, isn't demonisation &amp; isn't about the people of those entirely invented nations
