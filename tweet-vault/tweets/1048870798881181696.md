@statsepi @mendel_random @MariaGlymour @yudapearl I don't think of this as a competition. Methods co-exist. Use adjustment, IV and other observational methods (&amp;who knows, even front-door) to mount up evidence. If possible, confirm with RCT. Good observational work will help running more relevant RCTs.
