@Jabaluck @maximananyev @yudapearl I didn’t challenge design. I just think we shouldn’t equate “DAGs” with the strategy “First *one* DAG, then id’. 

For me the key insight in Pearl was to see structural models as fundamental, and id assumptions as restrictions on the set of considered structural models.
