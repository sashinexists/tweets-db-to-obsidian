Pleased to inform: The Supreme Court of Pakistan has deferred hearing our appeal of the Sindh Court decision that would free the four men convicted in the kidnapping and murder of our son, Daniel Pearl. We remain committed to pursuing our appeal and realizing justice for our son. https://t.co/NiFh3EG5Sf
