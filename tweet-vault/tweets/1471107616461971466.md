@yudapearl @stephensenn @AndrewPGrieve @PavlosMsaouel @soboleffspaces @smueller @ChristosArgyrop I really like seeing this discussion.  I think more people could benefit it if the key elements of the discussion could be written up as a topic in https://t.co/FQh46EFqdK so that more people could follow the lines of reasoning.
