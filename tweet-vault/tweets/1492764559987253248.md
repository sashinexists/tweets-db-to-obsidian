The identifiability of PNS, PN, PS is a property of the assumptions made, not of the method we use. If the assumptions dictate bounds, then no smart method can turn them into point estimates. I suspects the probabilities you get will turn into bounds as sample size increases. https://t.co/hKIe8Lm2zO
