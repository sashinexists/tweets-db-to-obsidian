@sakrejda @shravanvasishth @StatModeling @mcmc_stan You are being unfair by assuming apriori that what you see as "pettiness" is not genuine attempts to learn from each other.  I, for one, would very much like to hear more about what we can learn from the "broader search" that goes beyond "causal inference". Care to explicate?
