@guilhermejd1 @autoregress @analisereal @Chris_Auld @Jabaluck @gelbach @HeerJeet "Embrace"? You must be kidding. I guess the idea that potential outcomes are intrinsic properties of SCM  has not been sunk in yet. Every SCM model assigns a probability to every conceivable potential outcome. Potential outcomes are rooted in SCM, and trees
