@EngineerDiet @TuckerGoodrich @eitch_kay @InternalMentalC @DaveKeto @DrNadolsky It is healthy to separate the  "science of adjustment" from the "science of diseases". The former is valid whenever your assumptions about the former are valid. Moreover, and miraculously, the assumptions needed are qualitative: who affects whom. The rest is algebra. #Bookofwhy
