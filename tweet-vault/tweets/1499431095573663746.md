@stephensenn @yudapearl @f2harrell @soboleffspaces @SMuellerLab Suppose we want our trial to include an equal number of people receiving A and B.  We wish to do this because at a fixed sample size, the power to detect a treatment difference is maximized when an equal # receive A &amp;B.  We lose power as this drifts away from exactly equal.
