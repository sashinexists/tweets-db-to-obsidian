@HolgerSteinmetz @PHuenermund @Noahpinion Tell us more about psychology. Any major article unveiling how far behind the field is? Any embarrassing statement by the leaders? I know that Psychometrika just rejected an article on graphical methods, but this is not unusual; editors are paid to impede progress. What's new?
