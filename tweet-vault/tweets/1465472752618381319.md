@DKedmey @BayoumiMoustafa I agree. There should be a litmus test separating scholars from those who use their academic positions to propagate falsehoods, racism, if not genocidal agendas. The slogan 
"equally legitimate, equally indigenous" 
is such a litmus test. It has served me faithfully  in the past.
