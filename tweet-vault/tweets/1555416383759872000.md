@thinkyparts @ADL @JGreenblattADL "both sides"? No way!! In my school, a pupil who made a derogatory remark against Arabs was sent home to bring his parents. The frequency of the word "peace" in Hebrew folk-songs exceeds that  of "I love you". Please don't tell me about "both sides". I'm tuned to their textbooks.
