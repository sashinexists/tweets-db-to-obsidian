@ADAlthousePhD @RWJE_BA @soboleffspaces You are underestimating how reliably one can make such generalizations w/o reading every article written, based on one fact: The task involved requires a formal language (counterfactuals) which, based on inquiries and syntactic analysis, is non existent in a given literature.
