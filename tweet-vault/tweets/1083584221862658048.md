@cdsamii @yudapearl @PHuenermund @dhillon_p @deaneckles 1/3 I am glad to hear that u liked the paper,  but this was not the main motivation for raising the issue. Technically speaking, the paper claims to have solved a task within the theme extrapolation of causal effects, where the two central issues are identifiability &amp; estimation.
