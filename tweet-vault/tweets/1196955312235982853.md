@yudapearl @amitabhchandra2 I think you have the causation backwards. Researchers grab on to new tools that help them unlock new questions or make new progress on old questions. That creates demand for review papers that editors respond too.

Maybe it would be clearer if you wrote down your proposed DAG ðŸ˜‰
