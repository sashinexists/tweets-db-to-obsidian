@jonasobleser @dingding_peng @BrentWRoberts @jule_specht @sofievalk @jeremyfreese @yudapearl Sure, it's interesting to understand how problems come about! I guess the question is when you want to call an estimate a causal effect; and there are other opinions. TBC haven't made up my mind yet in this debate, so really ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, but think it's good to have in psych too!
