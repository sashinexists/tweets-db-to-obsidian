@MeganTStevenson @PHuenermund @paulgp @dlmillimet @pietrobiroli @yudapearl @eliasbareinboim @josh_t_dean @uhlily Yeah depending on the day. Idk Megan I definitely don't want to say I have all or even most of the answers here. I've learned a lot from many folks who've thought about this much longer from many different fields. The thing I think we agree on is something needs to change in econ
