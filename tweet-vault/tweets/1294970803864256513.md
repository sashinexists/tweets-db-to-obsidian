Two additional observations on skeptical ML practitioners:
(1) They have not been taught that, mathematically, causal models are NECESSARY for certain tasks, and (2) They have not been taught how to USE causal models even if they were handed one. (1) + (2) drives ML skepticism. https://t.co/qIX0gpIas8
