Chapter 3 adds 2 more criteria: temporal priority and contiguity. That is, causes should precede effects; and cause &amp; effect should be spatially adjacent. 

Temporal priority is nice because it creates the asymmetry that causation seems to exhibit: causation has a direction. https://t.co/dBRPjHLQoV
