Excellent choice. Unfortunately, when I say so people think I have a dog in the fight. So, judge for yourself; show me another book that gives you a no-nonsense introduction to causal inference. ie, one that can be taught in high school yet surprises even the greatest economists https://t.co/uPLF4vpu9u
