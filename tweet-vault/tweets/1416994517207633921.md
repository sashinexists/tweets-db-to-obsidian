@yudapearl @lewbel @VC31415 @causalinf Interesting! Such subjective variables would be scorned by physical scientists and frequentists (Frequentists would have an apoplectic fit over them) but make perfect sense to Bayesians and social scientists. I do think such subjective variables have a fuzzy temporal aspect too.
