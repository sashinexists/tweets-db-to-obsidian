@PWGTennant @statsepi @ADAlthousePhD @stephensenn @f2harrell @soboleffspaces @SMuellerLab We have a Rosetta Stone, called SCM, which tells you, for every (formally defined) relationship in Stat, Epi, Econ, and Cs how it relates to others, and how it is derived from an CSM. What it can't tell you is what hand-waved relationships mean. That's why I am working on CRT's.
