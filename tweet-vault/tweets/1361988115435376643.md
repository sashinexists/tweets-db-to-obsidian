@Jabaluck @AdanZBecerra1 @dmckenzie001 @jenniferdoleac @PHuenermund @causalinf Now we are getting someplace. Once we disambiguate that nebulous "conceptual knowledge" we can do all kind of   exercises and talk about "probability of ATE &lt; p", "plausibility that confounding &lt; q" and more. Each requires DAG-based logic. Sensitivity analysis is a good example.
