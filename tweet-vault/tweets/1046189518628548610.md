@KirkD_CO @muscovitebob It is not clear to me what Braingap considers to be "Having a clear understanding of the data". Simpson's paradox is a causal, not statistical dilemma,, the resolution of which requires an understanding of the causes behind the data, not the data. #Bookofwhy #causalinference
