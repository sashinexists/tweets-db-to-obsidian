@BomNaKub @tdietterich @roydanroy Keen observation! Note however that in RL, a_t stands for "action name" (eg move Knight to Q4) not for a proposition. The do-operator is needed when actions are specified by their effects (e.g., make me laugh, raise tax, paint it red.) to distinguish doing a_t from seeing a_t.
