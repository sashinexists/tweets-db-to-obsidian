@DToshkov @cdsamii @EpiEllie @yudapearl @FHaege If it's observational, we could use any type of associational model to mimic this behavior (e.g., bayes net), but this would be pure curve fitting. The implication is that we can 'explain' well the obs behavior, but the same is completely unrelated to the causal one. Make sense?
