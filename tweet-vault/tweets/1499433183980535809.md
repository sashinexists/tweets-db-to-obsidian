@stephensenn @yudapearl @f2harrell @soboleffspaces @SMuellerLab If you want people to engage with *your* work, demanding that the other party does all the translating and explaining for you seems an awfully awkward way of doing that.  Shouldn’t the burden be on you to learn the nuances of the field you’re saying does it all wrong first?
