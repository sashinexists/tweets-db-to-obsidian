@yudapearl @EpiEllie @causalinferenc @_MiguelHernan I myself am not so tied to the idea of a 'well defined intervention'. While it is clearly a very useful practical device, I think summary estimates can still be useful in many situations. I think the issue is purely how those values are interpreted and used.
