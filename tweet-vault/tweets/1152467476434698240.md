@AdanZBecerra1 @PHuenermund @AdanZBecerra1, I remember you from Gelman's blog. You reminded the discussants of DAGs and got bullied by one of the big guys who told you to go solve a "real life" problem. I was tempted to come to your rescue but those guys knew so much about "real-life"- got scared #Bookofwhy
