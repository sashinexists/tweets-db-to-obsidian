@Susan_Athey @joshgans How does one judge "better quality" in "empirical applications" where assumptions are debatable,  hardly articulable, and where we don't have ground truth against which to gauge improvement. The Golden Axiom says: He who cannot do it on a 4-variable problem, cannot do it period.
