@analisereal @convexify @paulnovosad @btshapir @yudapearl @eliasbareinboim that would be of great interest to applied economists, and I think lead us to revisit whether DAGs should be more commonly used. It would be a first step towards validating @yudeapearl 's claim that DAGs would lead econs to adopt alternative ID strategies.
