@yudapearl @federicarusso @soboleffspaces @dylanarmbruste3 @causalinf I see Evidential Pluralism as a general framework in which we can situate particular tools for causal evaluation, including SCMs, more general mechanistic models, RCTs, qualitative methods, mixed methods and others. I'm not sure where you find "helplessness".
