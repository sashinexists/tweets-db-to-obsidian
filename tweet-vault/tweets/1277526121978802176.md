I wish it was so easy but, today, saying: "I am against discrimination" automatically makes you an enemy of some people. E.g., The California legislature just voted to strike down the words "not discriminate" from its constitution. Orwellianism: You can't signal loyalty to anyone https://t.co/pTDZNnc0ue
