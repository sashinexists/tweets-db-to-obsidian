@RonKenett @stephensenn @learnfromerror I did not say "statistics does not have the tools to handle blocking." I said the phrase that you used: "this is one of the important areas of statistics" was also used 
about causality, since 1975. And I now
understand that it meant: "statistics cannot handle
causality" (cont.)
