@IsaacRothberg @cholent_lover Shocking! isn't it? How else can you explain Saeb Erakat attempt to appropriate the history of the Netufians and the Canaanites, of which Palestinians know absolutely nothing? As to peaceful aspirations, have you met a Palestinian leader willing to accept their neighbors?
