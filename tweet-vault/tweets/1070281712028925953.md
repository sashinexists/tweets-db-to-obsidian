@EpiEllie @yudapearl @zshahn @_MiguelHernan I did more skimming. I think the passage below is related to the "interventional" experiments notion. Rung 2 queries can be estimated by back-door/front-door criterion, but Rung 3 queries are harder (back-door/front-door criterion might not be sufficient for estimation). https://t.co/YqehQhADnb
