@instrumenthull @eliasbareinboim @analisereal @pablogerbas @alexpghayes @seanjtaylor @MatheusFacure I have not seen simultaneity or shape restriction being excluded from the structural framework (SCM). Have you? See Causality p.215-17 for simultaneity, See pp. 389-91 for shape restriction (Linearity). Only insecure disciplines are engaged in excluding new tools and notation.
