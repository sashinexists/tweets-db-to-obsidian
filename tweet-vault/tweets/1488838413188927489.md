@profnfenton @gottfriedmath @soboleffspaces @causalinf @nickchk @EpiEllie @MartinNeil9 Nice demonstration. However, note that you have assumed a functional relationship (linear) between Y and its parents. Moreover you are learning the priors of the invisible exogeneous variable U, not the visible exogeneous variables in the BN. These place your analysis within SCM.
