@yudapearl @dustinvtran @eliasbareinboim @jasonhartford @zacharylipton @CsabaSzepesvari @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @ShalitUri Education and application are mutually reinforcing, not mutually exclusive. I imagine there are few remaining ML courses that don't cover deep learning. This happened because of empirical success, not theoretical discussion.

I want this for causal! Let's make it happen!
