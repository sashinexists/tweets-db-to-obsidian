@yudapearl @Jacobb_Douglas @PHuenermund I know some questions are too tricky for twitter, but if you retreat to email none of the rest of us can follow along (or even try to do so). I have been so delighted to see all the debates on twitter - even when key players are cross with one another, it is illuminating.
