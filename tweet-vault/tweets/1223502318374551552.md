@KordingLab @danilobzdok @blei_lab @StatModeling 90% of living statisticians say the same:"I am interested in non-causal questions". Fine! But when a scholar titles a blog "causal inference"  you expect to see some interest in causal questions on that blog, not "you do yours and I'll do mine" #Bookofwhy
