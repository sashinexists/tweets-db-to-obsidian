@AndersHuitfeldt @_MiguelHernan @aynumazi @Harvard Are you familiar with Stalnaker-Lewis definition of "effect" in terms of "closest worlds"? It is also "not as easy to interpret" and formally isomorphic to DAGs and FFR.... Yet it is metaphysical, for it is not defined in terms of the way knowledge is represented by researchers.
