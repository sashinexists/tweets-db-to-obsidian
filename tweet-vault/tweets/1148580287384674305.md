@stephensenn @omaclaren @eliasbareinboim Consider: (1) I randomize a treatment X and record data in the form of x,y pairs. (2) I forget that these pairs came from RCT and imagine that they are iid samples from some distribution P(x,y) (3) I estimate E(Y|X=x) under this illusion. Will the illusion hurt me? #Bookofwhy
