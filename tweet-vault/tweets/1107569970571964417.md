@yskout @eliasbareinboim @autoregress @CarterPaddy A worthwhile endeavor! But be careful to choose a paper that, in case your result differ from the author's, you will be able to convince readers that yours are right. Perhaps by questioning one of the assumptions. So, choose an author who is explicit about assumptions - Rare!
