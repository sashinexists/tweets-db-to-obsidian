@eddericu @eliasbareinboim @EpiEllie @iwashyna @Amy_Bohnert @Research_ICU @NEJM @_MiguelHernan Speaking of "well-definedness", I am waiting to hear from @_MiguelHernan how they handle a measurement of blood-pressure. Do they delete it from the model? or leave it in the DAG and mark it as "dangerously non-manipulable"? If so, what do they do with the markings? #Bookofwhy
