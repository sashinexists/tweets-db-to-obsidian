@analisereal @PHuenermund Thank you (and thanks for your excellent ‘crash course’ paper).

Summarizing: Whether Z is a ‘good control’ here depends on which effect one is interested in: the ATE across the whole sample, or the CATE (Conditional) treatment effect for those whose X varies independently of Z.
