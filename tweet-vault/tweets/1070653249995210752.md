@mendel_random @stevesphd @jwbelmon 1/2 You keep demanding "real-world" conclusions, and I argue for division of labor: You discover a new drug and I will try to analyse your method and the reasons for its success, and express it analytically, so that others could use it in a totally different domain. Is it a deal?
