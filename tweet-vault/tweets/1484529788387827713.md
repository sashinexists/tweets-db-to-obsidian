@PHuenermund @yudapearl @causalinf @HenningStrandin @soboleffspaces @nickchk What *rule* of do-expressions forbids cross-world counterfactuals though? I know the difference between rung 3 &amp; rung 2. I have been trying to understand what specifically differentiates the notation of POs &amp; do-x.
