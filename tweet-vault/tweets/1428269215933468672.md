@yudapearl @eliasbareinboim @GelovenNan yes but "effect" sounds like a contrast (e.g. p(Y=y|X=x,do(A=1) - p(Y=y|X=x,do(A=0))

for decision making the "conditional potential outcome distribution" or the "conditional post-intervention distribution" (@analisereal) is better. It's a clunky word for a very important object
