@yudapearl @tdietterich @zittrain @eliasbareinboim @suchisaria With respect I think if we insist on what causal language is pure enough you will find it difficult for the ML community to embrace and use causal inference. In ML, the declarative part is important (often missing), but only part of the concerns.
