@yskout @Jabaluck @yudapearl @autoregress @PHuenermund @pablogerbas @juli_schuess @MariaGlymour @EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer @metrics52 @eliasbareinboim The answer is simple: when it comes to IVs, we economists can just conclude that we "understand the variation" in the variable (so there's no more confounding), and move on. I could try to explain how we do this , but the explanation is too large to fit the margins of this tweet.
