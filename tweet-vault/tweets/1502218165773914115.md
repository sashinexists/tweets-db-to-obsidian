@yudapearl @AndrewPGrieve @suiss70 @miquelporta In critical care it is conceivable to have an RCT free from:
1) fears &amp; expectations (unconscious patients)
2) consent (waiver in emergencies)
3) selection bias (randomise allcomers)
What's the difference between personalised and population-based decision making in this scenario?
