@fields_unsown @DrNo_MoMoney @SlezakPeter @btselem @hrw Read any mosque sermon, any textbook, any BDS "resolution", any oped written by a Palestinian intellectual and note how, invariably, after bemoaning current hardships, they go back to 1947-8 (even 1917) to decry the grand injustice done to the "indigenous" by the "colonialists"
