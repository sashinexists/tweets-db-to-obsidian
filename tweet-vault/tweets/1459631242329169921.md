@TaymAlsalti @yudapearl @DJMinded So I sympathize with Palestinians who cling to the view of us as colonialist. That anti-colonial violence has proven self-defeating against us doesn't mean there aren't gargantuan costs to giving up the anti-colonial paradigm. Both the wise path and the foolish one are painful.
