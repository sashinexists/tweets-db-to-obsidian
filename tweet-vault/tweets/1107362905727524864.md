@Jabaluck @btshapir @CarterPaddy In my humble field of computer science, if an editor smells that new tools are being developed in neighboring fields, possibly applicable to another, he/she sees it as an editorial duty to invite an introductory article to educate readers. Even stat journals do so, not econ.
