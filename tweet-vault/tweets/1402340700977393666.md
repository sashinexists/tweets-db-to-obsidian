@Observe89314530 @DrMikeH49 @surgeryontv @cadillacmuzicc @Eve_Barlow Perfect summary of the conflict. One side says: "We We We", the other says: "Me, Me, Me". I don't know why politicians say it's a "highly complicated issue". It's as simple as Tic Tac Toe, if we just listen to what the two sides are saying for the past one hundred years.
