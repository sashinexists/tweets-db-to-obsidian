@DrMikeH49 @Observe89314530 @surgeryontv @cadillacmuzicc @Eve_Barlow Indigeneity has two components, of equal weights: (1) physical presence and (2) Historical ties. Palestinians have (1), Jews have (2).  See https://t.co/9XOCOsqkIT
The Zionist compromise: equally indigenous. Zionophobic compromise: Me Me and Only Me.
