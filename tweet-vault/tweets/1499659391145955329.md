What do you know? The Polish translation of #Bookofwhy will soon become a best seller in Poland. I know my mother would have loved to hold a copy and it show off in her high school, in Kielce, Poland. Unfortunately, she hasn't taught me a word of Polish to enjoy this translation. https://t.co/qx2hBnwBVC
