Amazingly joyful celebration of Jerusalem Day! With unexpectedly high number of participants and, despite Hamas threats, and contrary to Al-Jazeera "reporting", a successfully managed and peaceful celebration with no major problems. Hats off to Israeli police and Israeli public. https://t.co/B1UPsLp38j
