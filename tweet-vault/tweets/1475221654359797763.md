Quite the opposite. We, Zionists, are laboring days and nights to distinguish "Judaism" the religion from "Jewishness" the peoplehood, from "yesterday Jews" or "Jews by birth only". We promise to classify you in the latter, if you promise never to say: "As a Jew". @FreeformMethod https://t.co/esDc02CN0q
