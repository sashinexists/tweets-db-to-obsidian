Cartwright"s dictum is so simple and so universal, like the conservation
of mass and energy. Yet it is so often ignored, especially by Bayesians.
Bayesianism today is a license to spray priors
on whatever you can't estimate, then wait
for the posteriors to peak, in case they do. https://t.co/HolchTeV2I
