Enjoyed my talk #PyData, thanks, and now sharing my opening motto: "Data is our window to reality, and data-science is the eyeglasses that enable us to see through that window. It is not a mirror, in which data see themselves interpolated under makeup. #Bookofwhy #causalinference https://t.co/slxTBcCyW7
