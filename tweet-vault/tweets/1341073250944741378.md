@VC31415 @yudapearl @JaapAbbring @Chris_Auld @DonskerClass @lewbel @PhilHaile @steventberry Your distinction being "not formal" is really an euphemism here üòÅ.
As Haile, I like to think that as an empiricist you can either do causal analysis (both structural and RFs ad in your labeling go in there) or descriptive analysis (which has a complementary, very valuable role).
