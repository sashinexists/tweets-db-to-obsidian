@yudapearl Thanks for responding. Apologies-the preprintâ€™s been updated &amp; simplified. I have removed the need to estimate odds &amp; likelihood ratios. If you or anyone find an error, I would be grateful if you point it out. I will address shortly causality, RRs, ORs &amp; LRs in another pre-print.
