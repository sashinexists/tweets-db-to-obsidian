@PWGTennant @ken_rothman @statsepi Using propensity score you make most of your model specification assumptions on exposure not outcome, so as @GermsAndNumbers said it can be better if ur more confident in those assumptions. But then youre estimating an effect conditional on PS which is maybe weird to interpret.
