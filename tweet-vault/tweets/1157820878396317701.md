But, when I draw a similar DAG for a cohort study, isn’t selection a consequence of *exposure* &amp; the match factor &amp; therefore *still* a collider? 

Why don’t we need to adjust for the match factor as a confounder / open collider path in a cohort study? What am I missing? 3/3. https://t.co/nNRudklCe0
