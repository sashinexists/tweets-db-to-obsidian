This picture of Rabbi Sacks is from my dialogue partner Dr. Akbar Ahmed https://t.co/X46u2nG64u
It reminds me of how the 3 of us visited Jewish and Muslim schools in London 2005 and he told the kids the story of Pharaoh daughter, who rescued Moses, to become a heroine to us Jews. https://t.co/19pcfdqbYx
