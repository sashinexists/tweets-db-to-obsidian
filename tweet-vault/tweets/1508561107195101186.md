@dylanarmbruste3 @RWJE_BA @soboleffspaces @noah_greifer @causalinf @EpiEllie @bveg3 I meant to reaffirm your observation that there is something strange with EBM logic. Instead answering you question of what the estimand is, and how to tell whether an RCT delivers an estimand, what we hear is repetition of the mantra that there is nothing above the RCT.
