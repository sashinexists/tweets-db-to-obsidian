@omaclaren @PHuenermund This is indeed a causal model that, in some deep sense, can compute the effect of rain on mud. Thus, presumably, one can use HCM to do every task in #causalinference, ie, decide which covariates to adjust for, decide if an ACE is identifiable, etc. Would you like to try on a toy?
