@jasonintrator @glogauer_jakob Universal liberalism is central indeed to Jewish life. But how: "Thou shall not oppress the stranger, because YOU know what it means, YOU were once a stranger..." Namely, if you forget YOUR collective memory, gone is your universal liberalism. Can't have one without the other.
