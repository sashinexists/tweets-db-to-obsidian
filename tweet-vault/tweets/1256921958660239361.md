@eyad_nawar @eliasbareinboim Determinism disappears if the action is disjunctive, as in "paint the wall either green or red",see  https://t.co/Sp82v4E8GF. From the painter viewpoint the action is deterministic (one choice) but from the policy maker, it is stochastic, not knowing what color will be chosen.
