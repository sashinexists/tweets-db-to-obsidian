@EpiEllie @pietrobiroli @PHuenermund @instrumenthull @paulgp @dlmillimet @eliasbareinboim It's not a matter of "intention" but of equality. The pre-intervention value of Z is equal to the value that Z  *would have had* under the other exposure, name under no intervention. Since "other exposure" is X=x*, as opposed to X=x, the prevailing value of X.
