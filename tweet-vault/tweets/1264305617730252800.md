@neu_rips @tdietterich @yudapearl I would not use the word "en masse" since there are not so many centers... but there are centers on DATA SCIENCE and now AI, and I don't feel CI is represented *at all* (possibly except for superficially citing the ideas &amp; other related buzzwords). I'll not do citations by name.
