@MeganTStevenson @PHuenermund @paulgp @dlmillimet @pietrobiroli @yudapearl @eliasbareinboim Because if I know the algorithmic mapping of various inputs, including self-reported race, to a decision I can see what decisions would have been different had self reported race been different, holding everything else fixed?
