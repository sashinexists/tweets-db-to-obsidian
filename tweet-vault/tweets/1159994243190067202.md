@Jabaluck @steventberry @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @yudapearl @MariaGlymour @autoregress I still don’t see how some descriptive stats need need a reduced form moniker.  I’d just call them facts or data. Or why some OLS needs to be rebaptized as “reduced form”.  Really if you get rigorous what is “reduced form”? Nothing but a loose catch name.
