@yudapearl @causalinf @jakewertz @Andrew___Baker @gelbach @CFCamerer @EricChyn @raulpacheco @mosenkis @Alan_Krueger @Econ_Sandy though I'm a big fan, I also find @yudapearl's statement below pretty bold. Asserting that X is "the first to..." requires showing why Frisch doesn't qualify (see Herfeld's new paper on Frisch's hypothetical experiments https://t.co/YYPEHz95jG), as well as Tinbergen &amp; Marschak https://t.co/f2oOEbnRWH
