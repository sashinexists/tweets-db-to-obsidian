@Canadian_JACD @yudapearl @EpiEllie @_MiguelHernan Agreed about the incorrect usage of strong words. FWIW I am not claiming to be an expert in Blood Pressure. However, unless I am mistaken, an increase in blood pressure is caused by a more fundamental issue which we have no direct way of measuring. How is that represented?
