I have a soft spot for Czechoslovakia, perhaps because it saved Israel in 1948, by shipping it 4,500 riffles to defend itself against the Arab invasion, perhaps b/c the Golem of Prague was my inspirational Robot, and perhaps b/c HaTikva's music is taken from Smetana's LaMoldava. https://t.co/PAjk1rLzvN
