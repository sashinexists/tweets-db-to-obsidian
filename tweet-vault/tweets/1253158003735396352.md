@yudapearl @Jabaluck @gelbach @HeerJeet It is difficult to say how complex models use "clean" quasi-random variation to get a causal estimate; consequently the tools you offer to "solve" such models (which often involve the assumption of *many* sources of clean variation) are less useful to us than you might think.
