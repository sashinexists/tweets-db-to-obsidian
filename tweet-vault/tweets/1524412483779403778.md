@saramagliacane @yudapearl @JorisMooij @eliasbareinboim @bschoelkopf @carlorovelli @seanmcarroll @FrancescoLocat8 @rosemary_ke Great paper indeed but it gives more of an intuition than a mathematical definition. Compare to Bayesian inference, where the goals (evaluate posterior / predictive / evidence) are super clear, and everyone can focus on methods. Don't feel like we have the equivalent for CRL yet.
