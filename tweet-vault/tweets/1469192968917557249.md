Luckily, the causal revolution has replaced the question of "convincing" with the question of "correctness": What do you need to do to make a matching estimator correct? Now, since matching is the same as "conditioning", the question is solved. #Bookofwhy p.273-5 gives examples. https://t.co/rrQiyM62HX
