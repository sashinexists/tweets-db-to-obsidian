@cdsamii @EpiEllie @yudapearl 2/2 In most of causal inference settings in Epi, the problem is that we only have observational data, which is very very far from any mechanistic type of understanding. The causal graph itself is already a summary of this understanding since it's impossible to get the mechanisms.
