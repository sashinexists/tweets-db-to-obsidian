@yudapearl @Tfeend Judea, seriously, you need to re-read our paper.

This time you may also notice that your Simpson's paradox description (in the "Causality" book and other places) doesn't describe what Simpson actually said.

You just describe confounding, which surely isn't a statistical notion.
