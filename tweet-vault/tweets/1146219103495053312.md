@alexdamour @yudapearl @dustinvtran @eliasbareinboim @jasonhartford @zacharylipton @CsabaSzepesvari @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @ShalitUri All FATE (fairness, accountability, transparency, &amp; ethics) case studies in ML are a product of not using CI. If race, gender, or age is correlated with some outcome but CI indicates the correlation is spurious, that's a case of ML bias/discrimination that CI could've prevented.
