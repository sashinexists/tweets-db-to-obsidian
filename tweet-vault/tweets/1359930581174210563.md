@DavidDeutschOxf @yaobviously "Making sense" (in my sense) begins indeed with a problem: "I can't answer a bunch of questions about a world which happened to generate the sensory data I have." If the questions cover all  3-Rungs of the ladder (and theory is needed to answer them) I feel "things make sense"
