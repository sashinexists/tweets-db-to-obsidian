The more I look at Hernan's classification of data-science: {description, prediction and #causalinference} the more I prefer the Ladder of Causation {Association, Intervention and Counterfactuals} as in #Bookofwhy. Perhaps b/c #causalinference is becoming "what everyone is doing" https://t.co/JKAVSGNLHr
