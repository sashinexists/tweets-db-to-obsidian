@davidmanheim @yudapearl @AndrewPessin @EinatWilf Yes but since Judaism was a religion before also being a (modern) nation, Zionism's not simply Jewish nationalism. If it were, then that's what it'd be called. So anti-nationalists must both express their opposition and give due regard to the specificity of what they're opposing.
