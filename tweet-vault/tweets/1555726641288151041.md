@instrumenthull @paulgp @dlmillimet @pietrobiroli @yudapearl I had a look at section 1 and your conceptual framework. It seems like you're defining a controlled direct effect, which allows you to sidestep a discussion whether Y* is affected by R, because you hold Y* constant. https://t.co/r66b453Cjz @eliasbareinboim
