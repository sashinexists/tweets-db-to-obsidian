@VladZamfir @oliverbeige @timelessdev @cryptoecongames Two remarks. (1) There are hordes of identities one can extract out of  probability theory. Why did Bayes' receive such prominence? (2) I am still searching for a definition of Bayesianism, not for what's wrong with its practitioners. #Bookofwhy
