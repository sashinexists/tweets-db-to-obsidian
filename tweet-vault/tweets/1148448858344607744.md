@Jabaluck @autoregress @MariaGlymour @PHuenermund @EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer @metrics52 Wrong. I answered it head on: "econs use too many in lieu of other approaches". I even proposed an explanation for this imbalance: X-econs avoid models because they do not know how to handle them mathematically. Care to estimate of % of Angrist's students who know how?#Bookofwhy
