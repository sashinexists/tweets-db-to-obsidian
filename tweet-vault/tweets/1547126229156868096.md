@GadSaad @AyannaPressley I do have the capacity of answering this question, but I'd rather keep mouth shut for fear that "my line of answering" would render me vulnerable to accusations of transphobia (or truthphobia) hence indirectly responsible for suicides among bald white men, a protected minority.
