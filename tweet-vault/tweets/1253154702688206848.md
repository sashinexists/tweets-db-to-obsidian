@yudapearl @gelbach @autoregress @HeerJeet Specifically, you insist that economists use a "cognitively meaningful and defensible encoding of what we know." You also claim elsewhere that your own work provides the *only* framework which accomplishes this. Therefore, you are in fact insisting on *your work*.
