@Corey_Yanofsky @stephensenn @omaclaren By "handle" you mean distinguish REs from FEs? Graphs show all direct effects within the causal model as arrows but I don't see how they would visually distinguish REs from FEs since the graph doesn't change if those effects fluctuate randomly. Perhaps @yudapearl can advise us?
