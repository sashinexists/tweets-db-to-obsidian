@geomblog @L_badikho @timnitGebru @Aaroth @mmitchell_ai @fatconference These people are wonderful, very broad, and technically superb. But all the King's horses and all the King's men can't turn a mathematical impossibility into a possibility. "Fairness" requires acknowledging certain impossibilities, else all King's men would be wasted.#Bookofwhy
