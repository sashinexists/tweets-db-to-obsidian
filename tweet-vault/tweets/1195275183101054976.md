@RonKenett @stephensenn @learnfromerror I am stuck on something much simpler. What is "block"? Is it what you DECIDE to block, or what you SHOULD block? Wikipedia says: "Block=Where units are similar to each other". Do you buy it? I'm also looking for a proof that if you block on some B you would do better. #Bookofwhy
