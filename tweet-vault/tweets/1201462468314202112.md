@juli_schuess @thosjleeper @StatStas @fraukolos @eliasbareinboim @mercer @ukohler @Lizstuartdc On first scan, this is a very valuable paper, connecting the huge survey-inference literature with causal graphs and showing how crucial design issues in the former are rooted in causal thinking and can now be formalized and made transparent in graphical models. Kudos! #Bookofwhy
