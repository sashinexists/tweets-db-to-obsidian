@VC31415 @lihua_lei_stat @yudapearl @artistexyz @ShalitUri @CasualBrady I don't think this illustrates the point because frontdoor and backdoor estimands identify the effect under distinct sets of assumptions. If we're not fixing the set of assumptions then positivity is never necessary: just let one assumption be effect=5, no confounding, etc
