Glad your club is discussing  "Causes of Effects vs. Effects of Causes"  https://t.co/v3KQZc426k, which is one of the most neglected topics in the literature (eg. only 45 Google citations). People who talk about "responsibility" and "personalized medicine" w/o CoE are kidding us. https://t.co/0O11Lcrhcx
