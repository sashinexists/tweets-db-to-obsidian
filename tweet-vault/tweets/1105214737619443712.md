@ale_martinello @_limbs_ @_limbs_  is asking a humble question: "shouldn't we question the usefulness of traditional vs modern methods?" Why is he being accused of "belittling/denigrating others"? When/how can we compare methods and display their faults and merits without being thus accused? #Bookofwhy
