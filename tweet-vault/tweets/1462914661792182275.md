@TaraZehut1981 @aihkas @borgesvit_r Evidently, the barbaric murder of Eli Kay has unleashed an unending fountain of wishful visions from Israel's neighbors. It seems useful to extend "Palestinian Mentality Day" into "Palestinian Mentality Week". I am all for it: Nov. 21 to Nov. 27. Just in time for Hanukah.
