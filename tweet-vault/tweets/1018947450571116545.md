@f2harrell @RandomlyWalking @eliasbareinboim Situations where posteriors converge to priors are very common, eg, all problems where a causal parameter is not identifiable. We cannot detect that before asymptotia, when all we have is noisy estimates of posteriors. Asymptotia saves us this labor (and embarrassment)
