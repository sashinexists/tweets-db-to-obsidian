Dear @SarahKSilverman,
I've been talking intensely to anti-Semites and anti-Zionists the past two decades. The former do not respect you even when you say: "I am a good Jew." The latter begin to respect you if you say:  "You are a Ziononophic racist, take a look at the mirror!" https://t.co/rwYqCIUM82
