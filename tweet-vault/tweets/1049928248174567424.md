@yudapearl @EpiDancer @EpiEllie In Economics, "observed data" and "underlying data generating process" are used do differentiate between what is implied by "see" and "do" operators. However, in Economics, the object of interest is always the DGP. So there is not much confusion. Same is not true for ML.
