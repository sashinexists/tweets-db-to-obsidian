@neurowitz @tyrell_turing @dileeplearning @KordingLab @AToliasLab Hah, I know Xaq. But I think of his work as going in the exact opposite direction! He shows how brains might implement ML algorithms like belief propagation. I think this direction of influence is much more common (eg Dasgupta and LSH in fly olfaction).
