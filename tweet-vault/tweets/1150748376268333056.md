@oliverbeige @VladZamfir @timelessdev @cryptoecongames 1/ For some people, Bayesianism is spraying priors on parameters and waiting for the posteriors to peak. For others, especially those who read Bayes (1763), Bayesianism means 1) leveraging subjective knowledge and 2) processing evidence by Bayes' Rule. I was in the second camp
