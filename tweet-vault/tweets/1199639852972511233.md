@EpiEllie @rohitpojha @AbbyCScience @Lester_Domes @_MiguelHernan @casualinfer I will bend to this nuance and talk only about my target being "an intent to implement a policy". Where would I go wrong viewing this intent to be my TARGET, not a TRIAL, vowing never to mention TRIAL when I define what I wish to estimate. Would such heresy hurt me? #Bookofwhy
