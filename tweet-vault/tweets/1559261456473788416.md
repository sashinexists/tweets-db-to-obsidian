I've just received @EinatWilf's new book - a MUST for those of us who are still pondering: Is there a path to peace in the ME? Note, she could have broaden the titled to read "The Path to Peace"; she didn't, boldly asserting: If you fear the path, you'll never walk it. Kudos! https://t.co/97pBL1ER3l
