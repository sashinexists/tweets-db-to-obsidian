@m_clem @julianschuess @analisereal @nickchk @yudapearl You could reformulate this problem in a mediation sense (just turn around the DAG). Then what you call ATE and CATE becomes the total effect of completing 5th grade, which almost surely leads to completion of 6th grade, versus the mediation effect that runs via 6th grade. https://t.co/KPhk6VAoP6
