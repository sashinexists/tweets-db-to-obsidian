Interesting. But I am tempting to believe that the Rasch's theory did not involve as drastic a paradigm shift as causal inference. The latter demands assumptions that could not be articulated in the language of statistics, eg. treatment does not change sex. Can you write it down? https://t.co/qxQdJqV2au
