@steventberry @Jabaluck Well taken, and internalized. But curious: Is "Modern Structural Modeling" different from DAGs? I usually call what I do "Structural Causal Models" (eg #Bookofwhy p.276). Of which DAGs and PO are 2 abstractions. Am I stepping on someone's toes? What does MSM say about control?
