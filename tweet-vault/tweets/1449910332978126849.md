It was a great honor for me, last night, to present the Daniel Pearl Award to Rabbi @bariweiss. Why "Rabbi"? Because "whoever learns anything from his fellow man, even an iota, calls him 'Rabbi'". I've learned a lot, partly about Hillel and Shammai, by mostly about  "Courage". https://t.co/7hcGHrAOzj
