@cadillacmuzicc @Observe89314530 @DrMikeH49 @surgeryontv @Eve_Barlow Hard to understand why it is so difficult to accept that Jewish heritage has been country-centrist and Palestinian heritage tribal-religion-centrist. That does not make the latter less qualified for nationhood today, if only they can learn to say "We" instead of "Me". They can't.
