@autoregress @amt_shrma @analisereal @maximananyev @Jabaluck @eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @PACESconsulting @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @HeerJeet No. Suppose Senators woo'd their former classmates by phone rather than in person. Random senator-to-senator phone outages on specific days would be great for identification. Senators always trying to phone college peers. Sometimes can't have any effect due to outage.
