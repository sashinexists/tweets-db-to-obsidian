@yudapearl @Jabaluck @MariaGlymour @PHuenermund @EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer Seems to me, we all agree that it's hard to swallow "conditional independence" (etc) without lower-level conditions. 

Judea wants these conditions formalized in a DAG, as this is a tractable way of specifying complex causal relationships, and reality is surely complex 1/3
