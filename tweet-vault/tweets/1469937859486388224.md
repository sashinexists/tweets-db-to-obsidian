@AndrewPGrieve @PavlosMsaouel @soboleffspaces @stephensenn @f2harrell Great paper! Surveying the literature, why NNT ain't easier to comprehend and why it ain't correct as defined. The latter is easy to see: NNT is laded with counterfactual notions and defined in term of RCT findings: Bingo! Impossible! A new survey is due, using Rung-3 language.
