I consider myself fortunate to have witnessed the miracle of Tel Aviv growing before my eyes. My grandfather landed on these dunes in 1924, and I was born, educated, and grew up with the bustling city on the right, its beaches, theatres, markets and bars. May she be protected. https://t.co/CUuzCUNET8
