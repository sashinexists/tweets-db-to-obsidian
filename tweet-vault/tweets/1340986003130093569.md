@VC31415 @yudapearl @Chris_Auld @DonskerClass @lewbel @PhilHaile @steventberry I agree that that is exactly the kind of analysis where econ can benefit from the recent SCM literature. It differs from the BLP, auction, contracting, oligopoly etc structural ectrics examples in that it does not have a fully specified economic (equilibrium) model to work with
