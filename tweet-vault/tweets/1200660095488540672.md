@yudapearl @Lester_Domes @EpiEllie @ConiByera @LucyStats @AlexaYakubovich @AnjaLeist @rohitpojha @AbbyCScience @_MiguelHernan @casualinfer Eg that’s my reading of the comments using the words ‘alone’ by one group and in ‘isolation’ or ‘comparison’ by another (see pics). Ie, regardless of Y(x) or E[Y(x)], there seems to be an argument about needing/wanting more than one x value, ie wanting a causal *function*. https://t.co/6qYNtPUnii
