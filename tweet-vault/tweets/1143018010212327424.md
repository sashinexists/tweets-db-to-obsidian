@shravanvasishth @analisereal @yudapearl @StatModeling @mcmc_stan @rlmcelreath Thanks for clarifying. I was curious because I've recently been confused by comments by others that suggest being Bayesian in statistical analysis automatically gives you purchase on causality. Trying to understand where this might be coming from.
