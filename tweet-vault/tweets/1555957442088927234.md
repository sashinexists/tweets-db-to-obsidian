@yudapearl @geomblog @instrumenthull @MeganTStevenson @PHuenermund @paulgp @dlmillimet @pietrobiroli @josh_t_dean Of course it can, but new tools are needed. My original bias before fairness was to think about the total effect (TE) &amp; how to decompose it (NDE/IE), but I was wrong, as shown in the paper above (https://t.co/CqOVe56MaH).
