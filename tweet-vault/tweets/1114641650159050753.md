@Jabaluck @autoregress @eliasbareinboim @juli_schuess @CarterPaddy I have tried to recover this thread, but it disappeared under a hundred later "notifications".  I believe @EpiEllie retweeted it, just two days ago. Any recollection, @EpiEllie ? We are searching for a Twitter discussion on "Must an IV be a cause of the treatment?" #Bookofwhy
