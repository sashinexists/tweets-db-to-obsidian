@stephensenn @yudapearl @AndrewPGrieve @PavlosMsaouel @f2harrell @smueller @ChristosArgyrop ah, i see… back to my ‘unnatural selection’ metaphor… i simply presented Pearl’s thinking as combining the observational study (where treatment choice is driven by natural reasons) and RCT (where it is controlled = ‘unnatural’)… no more than that
