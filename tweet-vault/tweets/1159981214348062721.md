@omaclaren @alexpghayes @steventberry @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @yudapearl @MariaGlymour @autoregress Does the idea of trying to conduct randomized experiments or finding "natural experiments" seem more natural to you? (e.g. compare people with test scores above and below the admissions threshold to determine the effect of going to college)
