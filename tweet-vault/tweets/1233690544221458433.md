@AdanZBecerra1 @learnfromerror @y2silence I think it was Don Rubin who coined the term "causal effect", evidently to distinguish it from something he thought to be "non-causal effects." I would venture to state that ALL "effects" are causal, and there is no point adding the adjective "causal" to remind us. @Bookofwhy
