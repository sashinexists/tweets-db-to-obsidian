@_MiguelHernan A different take on Cochran's contributions to #observational studies is available here: https://t.co/zMepynHLai, which emphasizes his "explanation of the mechanism by which the effect is produced" rather than "imitating" RCT's,
which #Bookofwhy advises against. https://t.co/oYq13KHUH5
