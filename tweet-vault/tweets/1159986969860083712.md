@IvanWerning @steventberry @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @yudapearl @MariaGlymour @autoregress Other papers are claiming knowledge of a counterfactual: "Free tuition will increase wages for the college educated by 4%". So I think this distinction is at least tenable (it's not the def'n I would have used before reading Phil's notes, but I'm 75% convinced it's better)
