@yudapearl @glogauer_jakob Antisemitism is the targeting of Jewish persons. I don't like this kind of representation of many of my fellow American Jews as dangerous traitors or whatever. Since Herzl, Jews in the diaspora have been divided about the role of Israel and it's weird to pretend otherwise.
