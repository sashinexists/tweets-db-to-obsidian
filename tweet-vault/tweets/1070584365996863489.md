@mendel_random @stevesphd @jwbelmon What part of current fixation with IV stems from cultural habit and populist mentality, as opposed to informed choice among alternatives? The latter requires that researchers study causal inference and then choose a method. Will they return to IV? I am eager to see. #Bookofwhy
