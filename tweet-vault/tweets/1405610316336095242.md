@seanjtaylor @yudapearl Is the OPE setup usually to use past experiments evaluating E(Y|do(X)), but evaluate E(Y|do(X*)) where X* is a functional of policy X and the functional has known constraints? Or is it more optimizations on CATE effects, like for cluster level policies on drivers/locations/riders
