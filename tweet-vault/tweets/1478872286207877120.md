@GaryMarcus @ylecun @_WEEXIAO @Vlad_S @drfeifei @yudapearl @neurobongo @TimKietzmann @demishassabis @sama @ilyasut @koraykv @AndrewYNg seems like @ylecun and @GaryMarcus don't actually deeply disagree :) lot of vision DL models have copy (e.g. instance segmentation where network is replicated across copies of the object instance), compare (memory), discrete positional information. room for a lot of such ops.
