Great line from @KeithKahnHarris: “David Miller is not an ‘anti-Zionist’. What he opposes is not really Zionism, it’s a product of his own invention.” The “it’s not antisemitic to criticise Zionism” defence is meaningless if the criticisms are actually of a conspiracist fantasy. https://t.co/9ikc5CI3Yk
