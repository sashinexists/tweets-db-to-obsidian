@yudapearl @DonskerClass @lewbel @PhilHaile @steventberry (Perhaps I am missing something, but here is the Figure 10 from Wright).  D (demand) and S (supply) are not directly observable, but they determine equilibrium P and quantity O.  Demand shifters (A) move demand (D), and supply shifters (B) move supply (D). https://t.co/8ya4s3C1I2
