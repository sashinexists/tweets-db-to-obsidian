@theblub @twainus @yhazony @ylecun @GaryMarcus @tdietterich @rodneyabrooks @lexfridman @haldaume3 @StanfordHAI @albertwenger @Joi 2/2  does not strike me as a legitimate question because I do not know what kind of answer would satisfy the questioner.  Take: "taste is what unicorns swear by" or "taste is a combination of neural activation that result in a scream 'SPICY'", which would be more satisfying? Why?
