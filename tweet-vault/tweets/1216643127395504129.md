@tdietterich @BethCarey12 @RaajeevVerma The right way to think about it is, first, to ask if the "evidence" is capable of ruling out members of the model space. The hardest thing for statisticians to swallow is that data can be equally compatible with each member of the space. So, we must act as if we've NO evidence.
