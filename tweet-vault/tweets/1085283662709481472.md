@GaryMarcus @Grady_Booch @RichardSocher My main concern is treating "abduction" as some special kind of inference. Probabilistic reasoning unifies deduction, induction, and abduction in a single, elegant framework. The difference isn't the kind of reasoning but the type of objects over which we are reasoning.
