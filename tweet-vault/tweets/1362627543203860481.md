If WCC wishes us to believe that they have not declared war on Israel, let them say so explicitly in a separate statement and unambiguous terms, no ifs no buts:
             We, WCC, stand for two-states for two peoples,
             Equally legitimate and equally indigenous. https://t.co/x85QTaMtHG
