@AngeloDalli @AdanZBecerra1 @learnfromerror @y2silence Of course! If the outcome of a random coin makes me win a dollar, then it is certainly causal. You are probably asking whether the dependence of the coin outcome on the way I flip it is causal. Classical mechanics says: Yes, despite the absence of prediction/control #Bookofwhy
