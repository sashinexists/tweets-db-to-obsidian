@yudapearl @JaapAbbring @Chris_Auld @DonskerClass @lewbel @PhilHaile @steventberry Most structural econometrics papers don’t use the CF/PÓ notation (beyond that given by economic model). The first law is implicit though.  Policies considered are typically not point interventions (do(X=x)) but do (X= X’), though of course the latter is a mixture of the former.
