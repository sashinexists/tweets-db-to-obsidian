It is a good time to map our discussion into a constructive decision problem: What is the right thing for post-1990's statisticians to do these days? Defend the honor of pre-1990's statisticians? or rejoice, acquire, use and teach the new algebra of causation? I'm w/ the latter. https://t.co/fsu4YfEyhS
