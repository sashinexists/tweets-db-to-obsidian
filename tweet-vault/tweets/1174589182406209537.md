@AdanZBecerra1 @yudapearl The main thing of interest was that Vanderweele agreed that "intervention" didn't mean anything beyond "hypothetical situation". Nice person to debate btw. Hernan not there sadly, his views may be different. I thought about writing it up myself but felt it wouldn't be right
