@causalinf @BitsyPerlman JCI is a high quality peer-reviewed journal. While it cannot guarantee you tenure, it can assure you top reviewers who know CI and appreciate ideas. It can also guarantee you readers who seek CI ideas, knowing they cannot get them in journals run by tenure-minded authors/editors.
