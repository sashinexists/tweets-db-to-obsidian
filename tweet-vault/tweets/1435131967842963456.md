@yudapearl @desai_pratik @bjorn_hogberg Simplicity can be measured e.g. with information theory. A theory is information. Occamâ€™s razor makes science seek the shortest way to explain past (and future) observation AND to predict the outcome of intervention. These filters are extremely powerful, as you know.
