The counterfactual framework with which I am familiar (eg https://t.co/Sf5yw328zl) needs no interventions to have "effects". The paper you cite represents the "potential outcome" framework, a relic of an age when causation was forced-married to RCT (or imitations of). #Bookofwhy https://t.co/3lg2dVTxDb
