@PHuenermund @julianschuess @analisereal @nickchk @yudapearl Thank you very much. Yes, in a meaningful sense it is wrong to call this a 'bias'. Controlling for 5th grade simply means that a different effect is being estimated, and estimated with less bias: the CATE of completing 6th, conditional on completing 5th.
