@Jabaluck @yudapearl If "auto-Angrist"=drawing DAGs to see what's identifiable, if we were honest w/our DAGs, we'd usually conclude that ID via back-door criterion is not possible w/measured vars. Auto-Angrist w/honest inputs would usually return us to the slog of looking for good quasi-experiments.
