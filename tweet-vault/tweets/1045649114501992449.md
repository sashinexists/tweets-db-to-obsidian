@juli_schuess @eliasbareinboim @deaneckles @yudapearl Not quite—we want, eg, to focus on what is perceived by the person hiring who is discriminating. It is at that level that the relevant intervention is defined IMO, not in trying to manipulate the applicant’s gender itself. Upshot: be precise, think in terms of interventions.
