@soboleffspaces @JanPotters @PaulNaish78 @AnnalsOfScience I agree with @soboleffspaces that we can learn a lot about the dynamics of paradigm shifts by studying the one unfolding before our very eyes, in causality. The anti-shift forces are quite different today, compared with the time of Planck; the echo-chambers are bigger &amp; tighter.
