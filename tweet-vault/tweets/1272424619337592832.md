@rodakker @JudaPearl And I wholeheartedly agree with your focus on the hypothetical nature of modern science. When folks object: "but I am not sure about the diagram" I answer: What if you were sure, would you know how to proceed? or what to test? Or how sensitive the answer is to what you dont know?
