@yudapearl @AndrewPGrieve @PavlosMsaouel @soboleffspaces @f2harrell @smueller @ChristosArgyrop Of course, you cannot enforce compliance. I assume that what you mean is that of the patients willing to be randomised 100% complied. Presumably,  those who refused to enter the trial might have a higher proportion of those who would also refuse to take a drug.
