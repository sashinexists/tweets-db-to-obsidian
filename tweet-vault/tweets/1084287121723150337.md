@omaclaren @yudapearl @PHuenermund Example: Smoking (S) -&gt; Tar(T) -&gt; Cancer(C) &amp; the unobserved genetics affects both S and C. We have non-experimetnal data p(S, T, C) &amp; need to estimate the effect of S on C. What should one do if the form of the diff equations are unknown? Is this a valid question? Could HM help?
