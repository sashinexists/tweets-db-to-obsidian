@georgemsavva @stephensenn @statsepi @georgemsavva, you hit it on the nail, thanks for making it explicit, and for stressing that #Bookofwhy deals with Lord's paradox, not with experimental design. Moreover, if we suspect Hall and Diet have separate effects on Weight, another diagram would resolve it just as well.
