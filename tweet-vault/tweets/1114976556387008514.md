@Jabaluck @autoregress @eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @juli_schuess @CarterPaddy I think we're broadly in agreement on the short-run effects. I think I'm more optimistic about potential long-run effects stemming from easier notation -&gt; more widespread formalization -&gt; more effective communication. But I don't think this is policy relevant for econ right now.
