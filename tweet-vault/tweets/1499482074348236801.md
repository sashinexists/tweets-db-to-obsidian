@statsepi @yudapearl @ADAlthousePhD @stephensenn @f2harrell @soboleffspaces @SMuellerLab Speaking as an epidemiologist the difference in language is quite daunting.  Epidemiology, statistics, computer science, and economics all have confusing different terms (and concepts don't always map one-to-one). It would be great to come up with a Rosetta Stone!
