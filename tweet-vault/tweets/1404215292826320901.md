@Antifa_TD @cadillacmuzicc @Observe89314530 @DrMikeH49 @surgeryontv @Eve_Barlow @EinatWilf FYI, I WAS THERE in 1947. I rode donkeys with Arab kids till 1947. My grandpa re-established the Biblical town of Bnai-Braq after paying cash for a piece of arid land (1924). His family perished  b/c  Arabs rioted when they tried to escape Nazis. That's where I got my education.
