@autoregress @yudapearl @Jabaluck @gelbach @HeerJeet Can you expand on what you mean by that? Applied papers that "use" potential outcomes usually just state identifying assumptions for common cases, such as Y_{d} _||_ D | X  (for SOO) or Y_{d} _||_ Z  (for IV). I have never seen a paper that uses PO to represent what they know.
