@VC31415 @yudapearl @JaapAbbring @Chris_Auld @DonskerClass @lewbel @PhilHaile @steventberry Complementary *efforts* but RFs are still *structural*. I thought Phil Haile has nicely explained the confusion about those categories in recent threads &amp; slides. From that perspective, Judea Pearl is right above that your "agnostics are skeptical" category is kind of... forced.
