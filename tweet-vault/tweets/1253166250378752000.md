@guilhermejd1 @autoregress @Jabaluck @gelbach @HeerJeet Agree with you completely. Economists have indeed been "concerned" with these questions, as were most scientists since Campbell etal. But when you ask them to solve a tiny problem, eg https://t.co/dEPwcuLbPS you see how far behind they have allowed their "concerns" to take them.
