@yudapearl @EngineerDiet @soboleffspaces @JFronczekMD @EpiEllie @f2harrell @ADAlthousePhD @artistexyz @statsepi @GuyattGH @GRADE_WG In my opinon ideal RCTs are not possible and may not be definable. I think the adjective was used by you first.
What is useful is to understand the difference between randomisation (which is possible) and random sampling (which is not).
