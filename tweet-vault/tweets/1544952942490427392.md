@shansiddiqi @KordingLab It matters bc you provide a "definition of causality" but you don't seem aware of the huge lit that already does this--and does it expertly.  

Maybe discuss with a philosopher next time? We can help in "synthesizing great thinkers" in philosophy, which you express interest in.
