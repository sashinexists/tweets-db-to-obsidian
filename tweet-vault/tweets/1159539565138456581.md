@PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @yudapearl @MariaGlymour Also, I don't think PO statements can all be expressed in DAGs (that was me being sloppy), they can all be expressed as structural causal models and DAGs can express the ones that don't involve simultaneity. Is that your understanding @PHuenermund ?
