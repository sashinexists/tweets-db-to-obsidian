@Jabaluck @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @yudapearl @MariaGlymour @autoregress Linear structural equations weren't necessarily derived from something else, etc. I think the confusion arises because some researchers (Lucas) would/will attack a model on the basis that it "isn't structural," and use a deeper underlying model to advance their argument.
