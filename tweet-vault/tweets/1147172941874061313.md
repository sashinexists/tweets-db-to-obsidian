@EpiEllie @AdamPalayew @yudapearl @causalinferenc @_MiguelHernan Yeah, I think I meant the study would find its way downstream - not that we'd be using an auto-DAGer. What I'm wondering is if we run into the danger each scenario being studied upstream being too hyper-specific for the downstream. How do we best inform the doctor/gamblers.
