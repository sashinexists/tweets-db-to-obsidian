@soboleffspaces @ADAlthousePhD @artistexyz @stephensenn @HL327 @JFronczekMD @EpiEllie @f2harrell @statsepi @GuyattGH @GRADE_WG So where is the center of the trialist camp? Is it the Society for Clinical Trials (SCT)? Are they as secret as our discussants? I see they have a conference in San-Diego in May. Would they be open to a few "getting to know you" questions from outsiders?
