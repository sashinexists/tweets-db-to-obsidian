10/

So, to summarize:

1. THC can cause acute psychosis.
2. There's a temporal association between early cannabis use and the later development of a psychotic disorder.
3. There's a clear dose-effect for #2: the association is stronger w/more frequent use &amp; more potent cannabis. https://t.co/hKO9J9VttX
