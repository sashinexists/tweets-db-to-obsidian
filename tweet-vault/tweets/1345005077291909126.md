I keep asking myself, over and over again: "How could they allow it to happen?" I do not blame the scientists themselves - they're paid to pursue the paradigm that made them successful. Nor do I blame funding agencies, industry and university -they are run by same scientists 1/2 https://t.co/H9q5j0XPJG
