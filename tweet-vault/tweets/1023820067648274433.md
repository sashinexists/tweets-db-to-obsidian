@EpiEllie @eliasbareinboim @yudapearl Btw, J. Woodward has an interesting discussion on this in "Making Things Happen". From what I recall, human capacity to manipulate is also not a requirement for him. But he cautions that the meaning of certain interventions (Caesar commanding UN forces) might indeed be unclear. https://t.co/wfelDA0j6d
