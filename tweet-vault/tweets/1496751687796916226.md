@yudapearl @AndrewPGrieve @suiss70 @miquelporta Number needed to treat has always been inplicitly counterfactually defined. People who use that metric insist on RCTs with trivial identifiability. They would never use the NNT if they suspect that the associational quantities do not directly correspond to the counterfacuals.
