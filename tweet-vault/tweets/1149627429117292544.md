@AndroSabashvili @_MiguelHernan Gee, I think I know why they discarded explanations; it goes back to the RCT's roots and the philosophy of "well defined interventions". You cannot define "undoing past events" unless you have manipulations; plain "events" cannot explain things, only manipulations can. #Bookofwhy
