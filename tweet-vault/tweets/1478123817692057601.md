My contention has been: A "science of data" is hardly a science unless it means "science of reality, as reflected through data" https://t.co/gWpMQEIWhX. The taxonomy you've asked for is part of "Data Fusion"  https://t.co/E1ap1N4ZCh. Note how nicely data sources are annotated. https://t.co/DetJFj4cPw
