@joshua_saxe @DebyNavarroR An important clarification is needed: by "Jewish" we mean Jewish in the peoplehood sense, not religion. Otherwise the Zionophobes will jump at you with: "Aha, you want a theocratic state! Like Iran or Egypt!"  Luckily the majority of Israelis are secular, bonded by heritage.
