Not sure if you received my comment https://t.co/8EdAiE7u3K, so I'm re-replying, and wish to restate my pride in you and your oped, and my renewed hope in Harvard students ability to deposit the Crimson Board episode deep down the Harvard Bin of Shame.
Happy Independence Day https://t.co/dFGn4i66p7
