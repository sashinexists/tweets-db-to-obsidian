@nntaleb @yudapearl @HarryDCrane Dangerous to argue about terms whose meaning is not agreed upon.

I saw Pearlâ€™s work as enhancing Bayesian inference by embedding it in a formalism that covers more complex situations. My (possibly ignorant) impression is that criticism of it applies to ordinary Bayesianism too.
