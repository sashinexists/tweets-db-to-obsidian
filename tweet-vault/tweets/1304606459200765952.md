My first contact with #causality was around 2005, at the beginning of my CS major, when I found a copy of @yudapearl’s “Causality” at the library. Back then I couldn’t understand it and I had nobody to talk about it either. Today, it makes total sense! What a blessing! #bookofwhy https://t.co/hAbtwGyG5Z
