@EsserHartmut @ingorohlfing @tomdrabowicz In social science, following Blalock Duncan et al, the ideas of testing and identifications are not new. But if you were a student of Suppes or Lewis, these ideas are new, b/c you cannot identify the effect of something (eg action) that you cannot represent. #Bookofwhy
