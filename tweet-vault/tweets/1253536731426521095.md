@Jabaluck @autoregress @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @HeerJeet The only economist I met who thought "carefully about DAGs" was the late Hal White. If you know more, they were not here:  https://t.co/Jf1SkgV3CK when I asked them to answer a few elementary questions, like which parameter can be identified by OLS, or which model is testable.
