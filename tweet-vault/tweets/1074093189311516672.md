Not entirely "empirical phenomena". You rely on ignorability assumptions in observational studies. Where do they come from? Ans. A model which resides in your mind, and which you suppress when you only allow it to imitate RCT's, instead of deriving PO's. #Bookofwhy #EpiTweeter https://t.co/XyjPhWihwE
