@yudapearl @mszargar @AsraNomani I will not legitimate settler colonialism. My family tree goes back 500 years+ in Palestine, until my parents were violently displaced by European Jewish militias in 1948. Judaism + Christianity have roots in the region but this does not mean all Jews + Christians are indigenous.
