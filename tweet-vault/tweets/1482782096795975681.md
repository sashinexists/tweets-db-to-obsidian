@RafAKazimi @swon26 @CAIRNational @bandlersbanter @HenMazzig @ADL @IlhanMN @RashidaTlaib @CoriBush This is the same "condemnation" style we heard from CAIR: "We love Jews", "We love their place of worship". Only "Zionist Synagogues are our enemies". Please challenge @RashidaTlaib to  distance herself from the latter -- she can't!
because the word Zionist makes Jews a people.
