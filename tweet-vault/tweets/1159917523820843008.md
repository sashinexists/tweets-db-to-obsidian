@ks445599 @dchackethal @SamHarrisOrg @yudapearl But you are not describing induction, but some very specific, and likely wrong, method of doing induction.

Induction is going from observations to some kind of generalization, set of rules, or model.

As babies all we have is observations, so something is doing induction.
