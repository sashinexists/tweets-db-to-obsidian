@causalinf @kneupane @ioanna1182 @thos_jones If you buy what statisticians claim about themselves, ie, that they are guided by and aim at causal understanding  (see  https://t.co/XFZYzAbLHy) then Stigler barely touches on that aspect. Morgan is good if you believe that she understands structural equations - I have doubts.
