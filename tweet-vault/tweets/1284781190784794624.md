Alchemists had one advantage over data scientists, they could recognize gold if/when they were to produce one. Ask a "data scientist" if her latest neural net answers her scientific question. The answer I often hear: "What question?" This is why I contest the SOUL of Data Science https://t.co/inT3zW6pdK
