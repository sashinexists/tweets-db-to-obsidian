@VC31415 @sbuhai @yudapearl @JaapAbbring @Chris_Auld @DonskerClass @lewbel @steventberry I agree.  This is in fact my dream: that we stop trying label things (RF, structural, causal,...) and just admit that we all make assumptions to pose and answer questions, and that the only real debate is over which models are most Box-useful.
