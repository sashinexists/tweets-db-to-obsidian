@alexdamour @yudapearl @CsabaSzepesvari @mendel_random The discussion is based on first principles, the math, and what you believe. I never thought you were talking in the name of your advisor and tried to treat you with the respect of an intellectually independent scholar. If I want to talk with your advisor, I would send him a msg.
