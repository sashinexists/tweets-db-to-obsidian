These wave-breakers are man-made, and the man who made them was my mom's cousin, Joe, sent to Rotterdam to study "port-engineering". From our conversations, I learned there're fancy tricks to the trade, all of which I forgot. What remained are these infinite waves. Tribute to Joe https://t.co/RcxslxH8sZ
