@eliasbareinboim @analisereal @yudapearl @PACESconsulting @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @Jabaluck @HeerJeet deciding what model to write and whether/how it can be solved are non-separable problems 

solving these problems requires mapping models to reality and learning about whether/how they might interact with real-world objects

solving models efficiently is of course still useful
