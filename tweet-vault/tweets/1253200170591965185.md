@Jabaluck @analisereal @yudapearl @gelbach @HeerJeet Let me not speak for Carlos but my guess is he's saying econs usually don't *start* with a fully specified model representing all institutional knowledge, but rather state simple t-dag assumptions + check them empirically

I'd agree if so, and argue this is a feature not a bug
