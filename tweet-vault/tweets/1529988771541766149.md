@TheAcsMan @hearNtalk @ShimonLevit @CNN CNN has a better track record, agree. That's why everybody is surprised by the amateurish way they reported on Shireen's death. My point: It's not sloppiness, but the result of a process where graduates of Al-Jazeera and Bir-Zeit have taken over CNN coverage of this conflict.
