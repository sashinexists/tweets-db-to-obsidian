@VC31415 @sbuhai @yudapearl @JaapAbbring @Chris_Auld @DonskerClass @lewbel @steventberry I can't speak for all of IO, but I agree with @sbuhai : there is no "causality" without a notion of a counterfactual, and a CF is defined only within a model (=structure).  LATE, for example, is a structural feature of possible interest, definable, e.g., in the PO model.
