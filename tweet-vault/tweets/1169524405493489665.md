@Jabaluck @yudapearl @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal When we justify the exogeneity of our instruments, we also need to know all possible confounders that might play a role. The same goes for justifying that there is no self-selection around the discontinuity threshold or that common trends hold.
