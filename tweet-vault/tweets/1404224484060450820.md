I am ashamed @SpeakerPelosi is a member of the party I voted for all my life, let alone a "Speaker", let alone one who used to spea truth to cameras. I am also ashamed at the CNN interviewer who did not jump from her chair with: "Did you say you "accepted" Omar's clarification?" https://t.co/e83sPikRA9
