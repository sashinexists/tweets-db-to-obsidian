@Jabaluck @autoregress @guilhermejd1 @analisereal @Chris_Auld @gelbach @HeerJeet This is the beauty of DAGs. You do not commit to a specific structural model. You commit only to the class that is compatible with your knowledge, namely, the source of variation of each variable. This is many time more meaningful than "which PO is ignorable conditional on whom"
