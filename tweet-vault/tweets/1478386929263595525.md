@PHuenermund @FriedrichHayek @eliasbareinboim Causal discovery is only part of the "Inference to the best explanation" (IBE) process. Given a causal graph there could still be several explanations to some unexpected event, which the theory of CI should try to sort out. Before CI, IBE was merely a sensible aspiration.
