@Yaron_Ramati @Ilhan I am not surprised. And I am sure that on this 4th of July, some English patriots are still insulted by the illegal &amp; traitorous act of the 13 Colonies declaring themselves no longer loyal to the
British Crown. It seems that, by definition, a noble act insults someone less noble.
