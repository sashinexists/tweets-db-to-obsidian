@onnlucky @dchackethal @SamHarrisOrg @yudapearl I don't think the last sentence is correct. Before we(or AGI) has empirical observations we can create a stream of conjectures that can be created independent of sensory input.

Computation plus the right program forms theories, observations enrich that but don't cause it.
