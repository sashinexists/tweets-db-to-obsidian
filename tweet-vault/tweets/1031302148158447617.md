@thosjleeper @eliasbareinboim @analisereal @maya_sen You hit it on the nail: "phenomena for which effects cannot be defined because the cause is poorly defined." Isn't it possible that such phenomena are fictional? or cultural habit?, a relic of Rubin's RCT roots which epidemiologists now should, but find hard to shake off?
