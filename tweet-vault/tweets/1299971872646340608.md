@Claire_Voltaire @pedroborbon3 If anyone wishes to see where Bundists thrive and how they dominate Jewish education, come to UCLA. Our "Center for Jewish Studies" hasn't celebrated/mentioned Israel's Independence Day the past 20 years. I often wonder if their students know that Israel has gained independence.
