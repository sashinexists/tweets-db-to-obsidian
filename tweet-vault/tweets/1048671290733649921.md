@mendel_random @MariaGlymour If I were  swayed by "give me one real-life example" voices in 1993, I would still be thinking regression today, perhaps sprinkled with ignorability justifications, but I would be scared of graphs, just writing books on why they spoil the youth. #Bookofwhy #causalinference 3/3
