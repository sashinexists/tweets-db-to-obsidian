@The_RickMc @PHuenermund @Jabaluck @quantadan @maximananyev 2/ Each varies systematically in its own dynamics. Yet, unless you are a smart alec and argue that some future-broker in LA may panic and call his clients to rush to their cars, the two variables are judged to be unconfounded. Randomization is sufficient, but not necessary.
