I have an example that can clarify my last Tweet day &amp; night. Consider a simple causal chain X---&gt;Y---&gt;Z. Try to express it in PO notation, and answer some questions about it. It is done here  https://t.co/3OwoJrNmkj, Eqs 6-8. Try it yourself, step by step, and see the darkness. https://t.co/SYk2tCtvzD
