I've seen it with gullible left-liberal journalists. They get invited to smooch with other l-liberal journalists and, forget facts and morals, they fall for the theory that whatever Israel does right it does to deflect attention from what it does wrong. How profound! @ggreenwald https://t.co/Vw18mqGcOx
