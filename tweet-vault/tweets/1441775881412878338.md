@stephensenn @yudapearl Thus if you fix weight, in order to stay in that fixed weight class, if something gets longer, it would need to get skinner or if it gets wider it needs to get shorter. It make sense. 

This is the correct understanding for a zoomed in perspective vs a zoomed out perspective
