@eliasbareinboim @iwashyna @yudapearl @eddericu @Amy_Bohnert @Research_ICU @NEJM @_MiguelHernan The target trial is hypothetical. 
Step 1: specify the protocol of the RCT you would do if you could (even if you canâ€™t actually). 
Step 2: design ur observational study to estimate the (usually per-protocol) effect you would have estimated if you had actually done that trial.
