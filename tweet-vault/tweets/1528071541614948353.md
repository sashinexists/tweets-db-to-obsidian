@aynumazi @yudapearl @AOC @deborahlipstadt @bellingcat As much as I respect Dr Pearl, I agree with you. And I didn't go down the rabid-hole to preach so much as from my sense that people might read these core tenets that are deeply felt but not always understood by folks who engage (though you may have heard these many times before).
