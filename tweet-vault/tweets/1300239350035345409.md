@yudapearl I am guessing not, since you suggest an epilogue. A while ago I liked reading this article https://t.co/DfRfVgnAjo which has a rather provocative intro. As someone who knows very little, I wanted to ask someone like you: What are some new perspectives on the nature of causality? https://t.co/V97KvvdJIt
