@PWGTennant @ProfMattFox @yudapearl @WhitneyEpi @ashley_naimi @mirschnitzer @lisabodnar I don't think an analysis where you use BMI as the exposure is useless. If you don't have other data, maybe it's the best you can do. But it's also not clear to me what to do with this information once you have estimated your "causal" effect.
