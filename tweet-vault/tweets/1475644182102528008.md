@yudapearl @rivkacjoseph @lsarsour Dear Judea, I have the highest positive hopes for Chile and our small Jewish community w the new President. Its hard to know what Boric actually thinks and what is influence from the hard left he was (is) associated with. I would say that Boric is far from been a Sarsour type.
