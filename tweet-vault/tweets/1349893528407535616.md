@VC31415 @yskout @PHuenermund Good. We are on the same page. But what is meant by "of course"? Is it self evident? Common knowledge? Common practice? A theorem? A definition? I recall Heckman objecting strongly to this equation-replacement operation.
See https://t.co/1eeVDweU74; would he agree with you?
