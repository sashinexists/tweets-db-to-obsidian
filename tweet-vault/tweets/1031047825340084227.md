@thosjleeper @yudapearl I take that by race you mean race perception, the action do(race = white) stands for the minimal change necessary for perceiving the person as "white". For instance, is it that hard to imagine (or model) the effect of race in real incidents like this one? https://t.co/g7BCW7GeFq
