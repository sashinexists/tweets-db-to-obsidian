@eliasbareinboim @saramagliacane @yudapearl @JorisMooij @bschoelkopf @carlorovelli @seanmcarroll @FrancescoLocat8 @rosemary_ke So we need to learn a mapping from pixels to high level causal variables such that those vars are accurately described by an SCM. By what criterion can we compare different choices of variables/mappings + SCMs on those vars?
