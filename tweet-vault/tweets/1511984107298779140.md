Amazing phenomenon! I look at these soldiers and I feel brotherly kinship. Why? We are not the same age, not of the same religion or ethnicity. What is it? I know! I used to wear the same uniform in my army days, 70 yrs ago. I wish I could join their table and sing: Hallelujah! https://t.co/IurnYbWsFz
