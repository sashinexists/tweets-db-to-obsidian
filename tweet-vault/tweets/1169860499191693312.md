@yudapearl @PHuenermund @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal But more importantly, you refuse to make assumptions you believe in and defend them. Pick any example you like, but not a made up one. Propose a method of estimating a causal effect that you, @yudapearl, actually believe will succeed. Write a DAG that you believe in.
