@yudapearl @Susan_Athey @joshgans I believe in some efficiency in the market for methods. Good ideas will find their way. E.g., I think that a good way to show how economists could benefit from DAGs is to show how many opportunities are missed in top papers by people not being aware of g-formula for panel data.
