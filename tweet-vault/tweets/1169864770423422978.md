@yudapearl @PHuenermund @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal I think there is a misunderstanding here about what was meant by tDAG. I'm happy for people to draw assumptions if they find it helpful and I'm not advocating for verbal or mental reasoning as opposed to formalism. In your language, I'm advocating for a procedure to build a DAG.
