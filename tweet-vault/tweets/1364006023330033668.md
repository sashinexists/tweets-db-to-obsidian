@MatthewZGindin @AllisonKSommer I grew up in Bnei Brak and I know those Litvak Rabbis inside out. They turned super-Zionophobic "lights" after 6,000 Zionist kids sacrificed their lives to rescue them from the "Rivers of Blood" that Azzam Pasha promised us in 1947-48. Glad some of us still live to tell history.
