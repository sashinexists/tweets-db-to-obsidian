@yudapearl @soboleffspaces @PavlosMsaouel @f2harrell @smueller @ChristosArgyrop @AndrewPGrieve @HL327 The basic assumption is that the treatment effect (difference drug minus control) is likely to vary less than the control group effect itself. If you would just take a little time to look at the TARGET study you might see the problem with your assumption https://t.co/YKOixjifim
