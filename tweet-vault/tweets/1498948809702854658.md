@stephensenn @raj_mehta @SMuellerLab I agree with your conclusion: "Numbers Needed to Treat [as usually estimated] cannot be used to assess the proportion of responders in clinical trials." But I do not understand the way you go about showing it. For me, "responders" is counterfactual notion, whereas "trial" is 
1/n
