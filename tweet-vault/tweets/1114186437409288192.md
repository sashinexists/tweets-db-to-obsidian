@Jabaluck @eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @juli_schuess @CarterPaddy I would still quibble with (2) -- "easy" depends on the assumed background knowledge and setup. Once you know the rules of DAGs showing frontdoor is easy; once you know probability/PO rules my three lines are similarly straightforward. Maybe my taste for PO is weird though! :P
