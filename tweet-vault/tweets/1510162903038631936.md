@RWJE_BA @dylanarmbruste3 @soboleffspaces @yudapearl @nickchk @Lizstuartdc @PWGTennant I see only one weakness in causal DAGs, when we have to face highly feedback-loopy causal phenomena (as often in biology and medicine). But pretending correlation alone is the solution is a mistaken simplification, a potentially dangerous one (especially in medicine).
