@Jabaluck @causalinf @PHuenermund @lewbel @Susan_Athey @pedrohcgs @snavarrol @TymonSloczynski @tdetonberry @MacroPru The W&amp;L paper cited is saying, if we commit to a class of DAGs with certain features, we get improved efficiency. To communicate what those features are, requires DAG language, eg. drivers, proxies, colliders, chains, etc. Often, a single dag suffices to encode those features.
