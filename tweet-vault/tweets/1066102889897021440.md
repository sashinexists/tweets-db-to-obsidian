@yudapearl @eliasbareinboim @jasonhartford @dustinvtran @zacharylipton @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @ShalitUri Let me protest again against identifying RL with a set of techniques. It is unnecessarily limiting to make this identification and RL researchers do not do this. Furthermore, any algorithm in RL that enjoys a theoretical guarantee will start with a causal model (MDP, POMDP, ..)
