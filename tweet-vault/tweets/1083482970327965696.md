@jim_savage_ @JimMinifie @Andrew___Baker @SueMarquezR @paulgp @jim_savage Appreciate the warning, good point. But I am not saying "must use my method". I am genuinely not aware of any definition of counterfactuals in structural equations, or any method of identifying counterfactual statements in the economics literature. Concrete pointer would help.
