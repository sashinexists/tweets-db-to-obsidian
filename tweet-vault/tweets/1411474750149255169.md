@MadamePratolung @b_subercaseaux @ylecun @GaryMarcus Not clear why the question of whether data-centric ML can produce AGI is "unnecessary". (By analogy) If SQR(2) cannot be expressed as a fraction p/q, and if billions of dollars are spent each year on finding p and q,  the question whether you really need p and q is important.
