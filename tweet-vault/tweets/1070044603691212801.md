@robertwplatt @zshahn @yudapearl @_MiguelHernan In that case, it would seem to imply rung 2 is causal effects for well-defined interventions, while rung 3 is causal effects for anything. But, that doesn’t agree with Pearl’s rejection of the well-defined intervention concept. So I don’t think that can be what he means.
