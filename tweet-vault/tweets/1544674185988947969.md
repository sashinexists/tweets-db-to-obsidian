@KordingLab For neuroscientists (&amp; others) interested in making sense of what “causality” means, I highly recommend @ranilillanjum &amp; @SDMumford’s book Causation in Science. 

They explain historical ideas on what a cause is &amp; isnt, + propose “tendency” as a useful &amp; workable scientific def. https://t.co/bSEEJdGlAz
