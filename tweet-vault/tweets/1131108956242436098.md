@yudapearl @twainus @yhazony @ylecun @GaryMarcus @tdietterich @rodneyabrooks @lexfridman @haldaume3 @StanfordHAI @albertwenger @Joi Just before I waste my own time: do you really want to learn, or have you already made up your mind? The way you speak sounds like the latter? You can only learn something if you are genuinely curious, not if you are searching for more confirmation of your belief in a nonstarter.
