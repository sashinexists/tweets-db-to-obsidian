@edwardhkennedy @analisereal @BreskinEpi Yes to the former - well-posedness requires more than identifiability, but people sometimes seem to equate the two eg when emphasising the two step 1. Define, 2. Estimate. My argument/question is whether we truly have a well-defined/well-posed problem with just identifiability
