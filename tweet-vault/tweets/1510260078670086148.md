@RJsnda @DavidDeutschOxf I don't see how a concept (EBM) can be "false" if it is not "falsifiable". My reading is that EBM is merely a list of hopeful desiderata, eg. "lets use all the evidence we have". How can anyone falsify such noble aspiration if we are not told how to combine pieces of evidence?
