The Dreyfus video reminds me of Marvin Minsky who once said: When I hear someone saying: "A computer cannot do Y", what he is really trying to say is: "I havn't got a clue what Y is".  I will change my mind if I someone translates Dreyfus into English, math or program. #Bookofwhy https://t.co/AmyWwjwcWn
