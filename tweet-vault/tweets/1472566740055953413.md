@yudapearl @soboleffspaces @AndrewPGrieve @PavlosMsaouel @f2harrell @smueller @ChristosArgyrop An example for you. There are thousands of confounding factors in RCTs that are 'eliminated' if  run as a cross-over trial (each patient is their own control) but none of these are eliminated in a parallel group trial. How are they dealt with?
