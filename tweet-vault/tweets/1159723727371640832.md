@maximananyev @Jabaluck @causalinf @steventberry @paulgp @lewbel @Undercoverhist A DAG is none other but a collection of answers to the question: "What is the source of variation in variable X?"  recorded as an arrow into X. What is often called "The DAG Approach" is consulting  those answers, instead of re-asking when they're needed in estimation. #Bookofwhy
