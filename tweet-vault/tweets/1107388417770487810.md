@Jabaluck @autoregress @yudapearl @CarterPaddy No, the issue is if the top econs can solve a 4-var example of the cleanest causal identification problems available (not asking to read a 30-page technical paper of my work, it would be unfair), If not doable, it's unlikely that the problem compounded w/ 10 others can be solved.
