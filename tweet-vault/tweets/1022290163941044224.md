@AndersHuitfeldt @analisereal @eliasbareinboim @_MiguelHernan @aynumazi @Harvard @robinsjami It is not a matter of "user friendly". It is a matter of defining "effect" in terms of what you know (diagram) or defining it in terms of metaphysical quantities, eg counterfactuals, and later show formal isomorphism. In SCM, counterfactuals are defined BY THE Model not converse.
