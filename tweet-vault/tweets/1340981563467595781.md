@JaapAbbring @VC31415 @Chris_Auld @DonskerClass @lewbel @PhilHaile @steventberry What theoretical framework do they rely on? IOW, do they have a definition of counterfactual Y_x (what Y would be had X been x, contrary to facts) with X endogenous? If they reject the "First Law" https://t.co/etASSEk4Or as "unnecessary", what do they consider to be "necessary"?
