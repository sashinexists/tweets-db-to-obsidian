@yudapearl @causalinf @steventberry @paulgp @lewbel @Undercoverhist But that leaves unstated how you decide which model to write down. You care about the impact of schooling on earnings. Which variables should you include in your DAG? Should you include something like, "Is my birthday before the cut-off to get a year of free tuition?"
