@BenMFreeman @Eve_Barlow @ADL I agree with @BenMFreeman. Skin color is but one among several immutable characteristics of a group that would qualify hatred  as "racism". Zionophobia, for example, earns its racist character by virtue of attacking an ingrained component of a people's identity. Please correct.
