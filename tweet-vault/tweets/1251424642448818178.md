Here is a fun question that came up in conversation with my grandson. If it is bouncing off the moving piston that speeds up molecules as gas is compressed, how come slow-moving and fast-moving pistons result in the same temperature increase? A question for AI reasoning systems. https://t.co/t51H3Q9PWp
