@maximananyev @TradeandMoney @yudapearl I'm familiar w/ basic causal methods. But, in practice, (for natural experiments) we do our best to match cohorts &amp; then do regression. Pearl has his criticism of propensity scores &amp; that's for later.

But (per my original ?), is the complaint just the lack of cohort matching?
