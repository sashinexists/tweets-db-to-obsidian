In 2002, when Causality received the Lakatos award from LSE, London appeared much more civilized. What we have been witnessing in the past 20 years is a banalization of evil masquerading as noble passion. Historians tell us that Nazi youngsters on Kristallnacht felt same passion. https://t.co/VAmwbC8DpD
