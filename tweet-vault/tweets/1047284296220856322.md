@ItsAStatLife @analisereal @yudapearl What about the rule 2 of do-calculus, i.e., checking if X _||_ Y | Z in G_{X underline}? G_{X underline} = Original graph with the edges outgoing from X are cut. The do-calc allows d-separation-like evaluations of invariances through inspection in these graphs. #causalinference
