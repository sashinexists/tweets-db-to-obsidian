@yudapearl @steventberry @VC31415 That said, I agree that dogmatic views about one type of structural model--PO, those built from behavioral primitives, DAGs--hinders progress. Economics would be better if we acknowledged that disagreements between these "camps" concern only Box-usefulness of particular models.
