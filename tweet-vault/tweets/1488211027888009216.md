@AsraNomani @mehdirhasan I would never honor a Zionophobe with the title "anti-Semite". The latter is a victim of unfortunate upbringing, alcoholic parents or God knows what. The former are calculating eliminationists; they know the genocidal consequences of their agenda and pursue it nevertheless.
