@ZachWritesStuff @CNNSotu @jaketapper States, indeed, just "exist", they have no rights. But when you tell your child: "Our neighbor has no right to exist" you are telling him: "We are not going to honor any peace agreement, forever". And you telling Israelis, you have compelling reasons to control those territories.
