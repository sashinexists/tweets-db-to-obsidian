@FeechPeach @KevinKay500bee @yudapearl When people stop telling me my view that Israel’s attitude to and it’s treatment of Palestine makes me anti Semitic then these signatories would have my support. My dislike of Israeli Govt actions does not mean I hate Jews or the Jewish faith merely Israeli political actions.
