@yudapearl @Canadian_JACD @EpiEllie @_MiguelHernan A DAG To can show that a measurement of increased blood pressure is "related" to some "disease" or "damage/health" risk. However, to claim that this is causal is dangerous and wrong. No diagnostic measurement can be "cause" for disease just an indicator of a tendency. Thoughts?
