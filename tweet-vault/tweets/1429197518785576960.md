Effect modification refers to changes in the magnitude of treatment effect by the value of some third variable; third, if you count treatment and outcome. It doesnâ€™t have to be a parent of outcome. A backdoor adjustment set becomes an effect modifier when you condition on it. https://t.co/zVVYDEFZXA
