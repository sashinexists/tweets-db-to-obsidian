In the 1970-80's, AI was all about "computational models of
mental processes". With the advent of ML, many now view AI as "algorithmic replacement of mental processes". We lost something in this transition, b/c the fun part of doing AI is gaining an understanding of ourselves. https://t.co/iqOl9FCMyl
