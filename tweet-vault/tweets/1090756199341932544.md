@f2harrell @davidmanheim Before asking about "putting a prior", which is an outdated stat habit, lets ask what "probability of causation" is, how to define it formally, and what we want the answer to tell us. The #Bookofwhy does it through PS (prob. of sufficiency) and PN(necessity). No prior needed.
