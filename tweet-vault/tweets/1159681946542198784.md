@Jabaluck @yudapearl @causalinf @steventberry @paulgp @lewbel @Undercoverhist I am not sure I understand all the distinctions made in this conversation. I agree that for any causal estimate it is important to pinpoint the source of variation in treatment that drives that estimate. If isolating that source is "design" then "design" is a key ingredient.
