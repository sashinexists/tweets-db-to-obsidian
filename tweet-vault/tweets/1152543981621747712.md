@AdanZBecerra1 @PHuenermund Another remarkable observation: none of the discussants had any clue on how to handle conditioning on post-treatment variables. The advice they got was: "Control for as many pre-treatment variables as you can." Is this the best place to learn how statisticians think? #Bookofwhy
