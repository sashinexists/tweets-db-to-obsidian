@yudapearl @SamerAbdelnour @mszargar @AsraNomani He cannot bring himself to say "equally indigenous" because he knows Palestinian Arabs are indigenous to the Hijaz, where their identity, ethos and culture were formed. Arabs to Hijaz are what Iroqois are to North America, what Jews are to land of Israel. https://t.co/oti9kUmzSZ
