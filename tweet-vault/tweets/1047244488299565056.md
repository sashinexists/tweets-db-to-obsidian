@ItsAStatLife @yudapearl Complexity is not important? This is a simple model where checking the condition Y(a) _|_ S(a) | W(a) is unnecessary even using a SWIG itself (once you know Y(a) || a, you could be done with the Swig and go back). This is tantamount to writing 1 + 1 = 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 2
