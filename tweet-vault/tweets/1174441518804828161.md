@JadePinkSameera @StatModeling @stephensenn @Lester_Domes @learnfromerror @_MiguelHernan @PhilDawid I am of the impression that such forum would be boring, because the differences, commonalities and miscommunications have been rehashed to exhaustion in the literature and Twitter. Note also that, sadly, "philosophers of statistics" show no interest in causal models. #Bookofwhy
