@eddericu @iwashyna @EpiEllie @Amy_Bohnert @Research_ICU @NEJM @_MiguelHernan Delving more and more does not tell us whether the research question
answered by "Target Trials" is the same as the one answered by "covariate-specific effect". Beside, why should we care about what RCT emulates if we can answer directly the research question at hand? #Bookofwhy
