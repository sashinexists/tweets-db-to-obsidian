@PhilHaile @VC31415 @JaapAbbring @Chris_Auld @DonskerClass @lewbel @steventberry I agree too (rare event) but I would add that, since both DAG and PO are derivable from SCM, and "the something else" has still not revealed itself, we might as well agree that SCM is the natural breeding grounds for counterfactual analysis.
