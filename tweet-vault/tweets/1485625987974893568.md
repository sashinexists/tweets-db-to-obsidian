@Medcifue @SPilleron @MaartenvSmeden @ZachHopkinsMD Today, with the help of graphs or potential outcomes, even statisticians can define confounding; they couldn't before Rubin 1974. Even today, those 90% who do not use graphs cannot tell when confounding exists, b/c "ignorability" is too opaque for mortals. https://t.co/qnvu54CxNg
