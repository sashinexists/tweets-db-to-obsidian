This is an important point: double robustness helps with statistical assumptions, not with causal assumptions. If you include a collider in your PS model, it doesn’t matter if your outcome model is still right—your DR estimator will be spoiled by the incorrect PS (and vice-versa) https://t.co/TuUyuvpFjf
