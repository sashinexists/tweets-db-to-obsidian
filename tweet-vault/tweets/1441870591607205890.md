We all know that politicians make difficult choices; no matter how you vote someone gets disappointed. But this is 1st time in history that a politician "CRIES" for a choice he/she made. @AOC's tears reflect her honest assessment of the moral character of her voters. I'd cry too. https://t.co/H6y0kkNE2z
