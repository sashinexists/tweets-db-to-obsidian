Wow! @jazchaz, I did not realize a hashtag #DanielPearlMusicDays exists! Now the whole world will sing "Mi Haish? Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking falsehood (fake news?). Shun evil and do good. Seek peace and chase after it."(Psalm). Counterfactual-Hoping? https://t.co/p3pTC49ake
