@yudapearl @autoregress @MariaGlymour @PHuenermund @EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer @metrics52 @yudapearl -- these toy problems are very nice. What about the real world? Can you give an example of an actual application in which they are relevant? My guess: the kinds of problems that economists would struggle to solve without DAGs arise in &lt;10% of cases.
