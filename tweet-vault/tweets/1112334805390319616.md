@dlmillimet @snavarrol @Jabaluck @yudapearl @a40ruhr @causalinf @PossebomVitor @nickchk Identification by authority is one problem, but it's also not great that everyone in seminars these days tries to come up with a "gut feel theory" on the spot in order to shoot down an ID strategy. We need more accumulation of evidence and engagement with the relevant literature.
