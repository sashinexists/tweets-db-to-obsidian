Professor,@yudapearl thanks for your profound insight,which wipe off my puzzle about confounding. 
I have two questions.
1. Is the Rule 3 necessary? What I mean is can we deduce Rule 3 from Rule 1 and Rule 2? Is Rule 3 just a brief Corollary? 
2. Is there a arrow missing here? https://t.co/tu9mZVP9xB
