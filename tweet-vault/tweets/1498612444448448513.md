@raj_mehta @stephensenn @smueller @miquelporta @f2harrell @suiss70 I, too, suspect that Altman would have agreed with me. He seems to be open minded, open even to the realization that he DID NOT note the counterfactual, unobserved nature of each "benefit" and "harm". Namely, his results are valid ONLY if treatment can never harm anyone.
