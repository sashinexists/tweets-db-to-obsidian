@DJMinded @havivrettiggur Fair question. Several NGO's in Israel are tuned to Palestinian schools, media &amp; mosques for an INKLING of acceptance -- none thus far, just plans of elimination. From your question I surmise you can name ONE Palestinian who accepts
(in Arabic) Israel's permanence; please do.
