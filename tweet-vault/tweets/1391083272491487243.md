@yudapearl @mellifluousfuck @cest_leif These concepts of (anti-)Zionism are subjective and their meaning evolves over time. You may have your own subjective view, but other Jews see it differently. Many, myself included, think using antisemitism as a cover for Israeli policies does no favors to our people.
