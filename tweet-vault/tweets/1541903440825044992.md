@BrettWilkinsSF @impsardo @questionsin2014 @elderofziyon An interesting new logic. Israel is guiltier because she is hated more viciously, by more creative gang of predators, able to stockpile a richer arsenal of populist slogans, fabricated more craftily for Western minds to fall for. The more battered, the guiltier.
