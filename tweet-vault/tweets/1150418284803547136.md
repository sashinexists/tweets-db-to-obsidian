@ipyadev @_MiguelHernan @JohannesTextor In DAGs all variables are presumed to be "effect modifiers" by the nonparametric nature of the assumptions. You probably meant to ask: How do we mark variables that are NOT effect modifiers. My question: for what purpose? ie What would those marks enable you to do? #Bookofwhy
