@cadillacmuzicc @Observe89314530 @DrMikeH49 @surgeryontv @Eve_Barlow Beg to disappoint you. "That sentiment of a country" has existed way before the 19th Century, it's called "Jewish heritage." Every child in Israel can quote you a 2000 yr old Bibl. poem for Mt. Carmel, Mt. Tabor, Mt. Gilboa, etc.
The Jewish calendar has 5-6 national holidays.
