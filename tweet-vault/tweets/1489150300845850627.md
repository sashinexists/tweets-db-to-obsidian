@Plank93621370 @Ostrov_A Proclaiming that a Jewish state is "a fact" does not negate the proclaimer's intent to promote its destruction. What I am calling for is on @AmnestyUS to recognize the right of Israel to distinguish those who seek her destruction from others; such distinction is NOT apartheid.
