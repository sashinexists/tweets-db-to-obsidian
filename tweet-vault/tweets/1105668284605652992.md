A few notes on the history of Simpson's Paradox. (1) The first reversal was noted by Cohen and Nagel (1934, p.449). (2)Simpson was indeed the first to note that what we judge as "sensible" depends on the STORY, not on the data [did not say "causal"] (3) In Causality (p. 177) https://t.co/Pdct1ZV7rs
