@lihua_lei_stat @BetsyOgburn @jiafengchen42 @VC31415 @artistexyz @ShalitUri @CasualBrady I would advise against the "super-population" metaphor, because you lose sight of the fact that all results are still sensitive to the structure of the causal model, and the query is still a causal query, not just statistical functional over the observables.
