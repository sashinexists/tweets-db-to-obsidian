@yudapearl @JaapAbbring @Chris_Auld @DonskerClass @lewbel @PhilHaile @steventberry I donâ€™t think it is about the First Law at all. It is about whether one uses structural economic models to learn about its parameters and answer counterfactual exercises.  The rejection of economic models is driven primarily by the desire to be agnostic/robust.
