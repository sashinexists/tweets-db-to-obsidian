I love this article @ShMMor, with one exception -- it does not name the offender. "Anti-Zionism" sounds like some sort of a benign political opinion, socialism, Maoism, anti-liberalism, etc. Zionophobia better expresses the racist and moral deformity of the Anti-Zionist agenda. https://t.co/7fygO3QhbS
