@yudapearl Back to my Q: the text below 5.10 suggests 

beta= r_YX.Z / r_WX 

as an estimator of the effect of W on Y.  But

beta1 = r_YX.Z / r_WX.Z 

is more efficient.  Can we get beta1 off the DAG?  

To illustrate, here's a wee simulation of both, with 5.10 as the DGP, true value=1.0. https://t.co/lvqGb2h4QF
