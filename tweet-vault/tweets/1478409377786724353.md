@yudapearl @PHuenermund @FriedrichHayek @eliasbareinboim It effectively dispels the myth that DAGs "encode direct causal effects between variables". Arrows are nothing more than dependencies and their directions. By assuming that arrows are conditional probabilities, we link a network of dependencies to multivariate distributions.
