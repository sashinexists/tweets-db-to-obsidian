@raquelrguima @she_knows_a_key If we have big data,  we can estimate PS for each stratum with high precision, with no modeling assumptions. At this point the c-equivalence Theorem kicks in and says: Yes, the bias will be exactly the same, for any set of covariates. #Bookofwhy, #causalinference Nice Theorem !!
