@JamesSteeleII @SamueleMarcora @harryrutter @cavilln @AdrianBauman @fiona_bull @WHOBulletin What I would truly prefer is an explication of what the arrows (or edges) mean. The caption says "drive activity", which sounds causal and directional. More important, what do we want to convey when we connect X to Y but NOT to Z, even though Y is connected to Z. #Bookofwhy
