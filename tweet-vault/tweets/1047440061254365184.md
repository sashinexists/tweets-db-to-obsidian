@ItsAStatLife @eliasbareinboim @analisereal SWIGS are an expansion of DAGs to those who need to touch Y(a). FINE. But when marketed and taught as a replacement to DAGs, stripped of do-calculus, they act as handcuffed mutations of DAGs, unable to tell even what they can or can't do with varying treatments. #causalinference
