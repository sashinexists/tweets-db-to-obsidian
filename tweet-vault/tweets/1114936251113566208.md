@Jabaluck @autoregress @eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @juli_schuess @CarterPaddy Both functional and formal understanding are valuable. We could skip formal if it's costly. But in this case, formal is also a good pedagogical method, so I think it does not crowd out, but can actually crowd in, functional understanding.
