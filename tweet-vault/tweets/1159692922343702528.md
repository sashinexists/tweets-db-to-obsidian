@Jabaluck @yudapearl @causalinf @steventberry @paulgp @lewbel @Undercoverhist I think that DAG approach as an instrument for "design discovery" would only work in a field where people agree on which arrows are missing in a DAG. Many areas of economics are not at this stage yet. So for a lot of questions, "quasi-experiments" is the only game in town.
