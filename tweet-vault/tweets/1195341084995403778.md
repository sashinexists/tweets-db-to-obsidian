@stephensenn @RonKenett @learnfromerror May I assume that Nelder's "allocation map" is the notational device that I was searching for? "Reading" will be situated differently than "age", and he has the mathematics to tell us that "age" is a good block, while "reading" may be terrible. Did I get it right? #Bookofwhy
