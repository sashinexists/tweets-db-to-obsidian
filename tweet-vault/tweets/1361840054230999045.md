@yudapearl @AdanZBecerra1 @dmckenzie001 @jenniferdoleac @PHuenermund @causalinf To be clear, I would certainly use more respectful language with someone who made a more sincere effort to understand the position of others. But in any case, you have not answered the question above: can you build an AI that can learn to distinguish good and bad DAGs?
