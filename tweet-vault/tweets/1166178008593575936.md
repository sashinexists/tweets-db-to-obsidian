@jwbelmon @acedens @f2harrell @cecilejanssens @venkmurthy @euanashley @yudapearl @PWGTennant I don’t know what the context for the quote is, but I don’t disagree that most of biology is continuous nor that diagnoses are, by definition, categorical. I think this is a big challenge for research &amp; is part of why we need clear, well-specified causal questions.
