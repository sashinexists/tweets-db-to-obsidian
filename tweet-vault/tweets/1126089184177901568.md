@JDHaltigan @juli_schuess @doinkboy I sure do, but not as a stand-alone argument. Why? Because to model-blind researchers  "confounding" is just "nonignorability" which is defined relative to
a "treatment," and requires no notion of "cause". See how Imbens and Rubin labor
to explain "unconfoundedness." #Bookofwhy
