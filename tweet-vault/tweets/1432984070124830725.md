Loved reading @gileadamit's article in @TheEconomist  where he imagines a fictional scenario in which a machine is awarded the Nobel prize in medicine. My favourite part is the imagined Nobel prize winner is a causal model! Defo one for fans of @yudapearl https://t.co/k0XvsUenlX https://t.co/ymKEWpcJDn
