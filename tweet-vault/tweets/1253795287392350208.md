@HannesMalmberg1 @Jabaluck @maximananyev When I see the word "design", I see a potential for an exciting PhD project: Let's take the mental model that gives the "designer" a feeling of "design", formalize it, and show the designer how to design things better. This was done in several key areas, and science progresses.
