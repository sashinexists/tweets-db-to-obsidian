@DKedmey @NeilRogachevsky @NeilRogachevsky raises good points. Investment in Jewish-Zionist education is the key, including Hebrew,  Bible and History. To be chosen carefully, because much of Jewish education is already hijacked by TikunOlamniks, &amp; I bet aberrations like Beinart do speak Hebrew.
