@malco_barrett @NeuroStats @l__ds @ken_rothman @EpiEllie If A is a sufficient cause, so is any event B=1. Why? Because A is logically equivalent to (A &amp; B=1) OR (A &amp; B=0).  [See Causality Section 10.1.4. for discussion]. The notion of "sufficiency" described in #Bookofwhy is invariant to syntax and, surely, prefers Match to Oxygen. 3/3
