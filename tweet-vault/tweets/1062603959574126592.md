@Megtron9 @Lizstuartdc @analisereal @ProfMattFox @yudapearl The sentences "specific estimate being valid for a target" &amp; "one could generalize given the SD" seem the same. If generalizability is not allowed, could the specific estimate be "valid"? No. The validity of the estimate, however, is contingent on the SD.  https://t.co/A12VmR1JDC
