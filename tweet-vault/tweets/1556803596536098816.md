@EpiEllie @pietrobiroli @PHuenermund @instrumenthull @paulgp @dlmillimet @eliasbareinboim I do not see any assumption needed for this innocent definition: "The expected change in Y while keeping all mediators at whatever values they  had before the change (of the exposure)"
I frankly do not see any threats coming from "time-varying causes" or "time-invariant causes".
