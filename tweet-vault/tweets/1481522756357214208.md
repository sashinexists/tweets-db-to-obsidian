@FJnyc @KeshetGLBTJews @farra @JTAnews @kampeas @Hartman_Inst @SheilaKatz1 @JTSVoice @JewishBoard @RRC_edu @robertevanbank @jfsla @HIASrefugees @IzaTabaro @EinatWilf We live in an era where "refusing service" is how we serve a noble cause. Rumor has it that McDonald refuses Big Mac (or was it Big Duck) to customers walking like pedophiles. The company could not find a more convincing way of projecting its virtue. It's still in business.
