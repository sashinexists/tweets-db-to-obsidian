@Jabaluck @pablogerbas @juli_schuess @yudapearl @fuzzydunlop123 @autoregress @MariaGlymour @EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer @metrics52 I already said that I don't hold anything against the authors. As far as I can tell their paper is state-of-the-art and a solid piece of work. Still I think that research practices in the field at large could be improved drastically by adopting DAGs, for the reasons stated.
