@Jabaluck @alexpghayes @steventberry @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @yudapearl @MariaGlymour @autoregress I suppose I don’t see it as ‘model with DAGs’ vs ‘conduct experiments’. I’m talking more ‘model with DAGs’ vs ‘model with conservation &amp; constitutive equations’ etc - ie I find the ‘modelling formalisms’ of econ weird. Where are the differential equations? What is conserved? Etc
