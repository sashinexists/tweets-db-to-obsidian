@CalebMiles16 @ildiazm I do not believe the information provided by the mediator Z is a convincing explanation as to why the product of the estimators is better than the one-shot estimator. If we look at the saturated case (Appendix II  https://t.co/yhZkbH7E8v), observing Z does not help. #Bookofwhy
