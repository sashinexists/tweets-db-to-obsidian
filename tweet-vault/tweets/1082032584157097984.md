Here’s an example from #bookofwhy I’m a little confused on. @yudapearl says that B could occur before A in M diagram, even though A is a cause of B. Is this because C is also a cause of B? But generically wouldn’t we need to also know the value of A before we can determine B? https://t.co/3dMpNQiFYy
