@PWGTennant @ProfMattFox @yudapearl @WhitneyEpi @ashley_naimi @mirschnitzer @lisabodnar We've enjoyed these exposures like BMI, SEP etc for a long time because they're succinct ways of summarizing multi-dimensional phenomena. With the cost of data collection, this is understandably really appealing!
