@heinz_r @UlrichJunker @GaryMarcus Thanks for posting. Illuminating talk, though there were only a few slides I truly understood. I have this weakness of absorbing mathematical theorems better than description of systems. I'll have to read the papers to see how CI can benefit from this enhanced mode of learning.
