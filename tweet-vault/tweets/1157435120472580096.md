@jasonintrator @glogauer_jakob Herzl, Jews in the diaspora have been divided about the role of Israel as a practical solution to the immediate problems Jews faced then. That role was never debated in my (and your?) grandfather house, where they prayed 3 times a day: "He will walk us in sovereignty to our land"
