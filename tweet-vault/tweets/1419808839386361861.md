Dr. Judea Pearl has condemned bigotry of UCLA’s Asian-American Studies Dept. that’s repeated slanders, anti-Israel, anti-Semitic tropes. At a time when SWC &amp; Jewish community stands with our Asian-American neighbors subjected to hate crimes, this attack is especially disgusting! https://t.co/GL0BtFdaUm
