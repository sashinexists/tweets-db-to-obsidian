@joe_shipman @nntaleb @HarryDCrane Sorry if I misinterpret you meaning of "meaning", it reminded me how I used to argue with Stats who kept insisting on "SEM has no meaning" or "the only meaning of y=ax+eps is E[Y|x]=ax" [Holland 1988] etc. etc. The influx of Tweets from @nntaleb followers reminded me of old days.
