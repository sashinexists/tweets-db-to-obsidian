Jokes aside. Statistics is in dire need of a textbook on "Statistical Regression Analysis: A Causal perspective". It should be easy to write, just take the most popular regression textbook written, and explicate the thought that the author has been trying to hide. A best seller! https://t.co/laHAYxCvcx
