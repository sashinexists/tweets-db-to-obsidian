1/n
Tired of caricatures? Note that we never construct a dag by listing 150,ooo variables. We start by asking: can you think of a variable affecting both X and Y? Is it measured? If not, is it significant? If yes, lump it together with all other such variables and mark it U, https://t.co/B9I2kVtOK5
