@UrbanHealthProf @mendel_random @yudapearl @IJEeditorial @PWGTennant My prior: some researchers have a very good understanding of causal structure, and DAGs don't help them much (because they have DAGs in their heads).  On the other hand, some use DAGs like the old saying, for support rather than illumination.
