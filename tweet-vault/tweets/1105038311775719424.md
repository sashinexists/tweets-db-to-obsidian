Glad you like #Bookofwhy. But where is "bashing of statisticians"? This is what the book says about statisticians: "...they declared those questions off limits and turned to developing a thriving, causality-free enterprise called statistics." This is not "bashing", it is history. https://t.co/WJMOKBRnW5
