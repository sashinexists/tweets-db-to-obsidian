Nice idea, the problem is that comparing "pedagogical approaches" entails (1) instructors able to participate and (2) agreeable criteria of success. Try to author a final exam to measure effectiveness and the gurus will object: "No toy examples, real-life only!" Back to darkness. https://t.co/lkKyekMPcu
