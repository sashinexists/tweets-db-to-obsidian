@steventberry @lewbel @yudapearl @causalinf @PHuenermund @econbookclub @analisereal @jdramirezc @PhilHaile Also, that version of S &amp; D appears in econometrics textbooks, but rarely elsewhere.  In conventional sim systems it amounts to same thing, but if we start with

Q_D = f(P)
Q_S = g(P)
p:  Q_D = Q_S

where 3rd eq is eq'm, can we represent with directed graphs?
