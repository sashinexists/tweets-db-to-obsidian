@HL327 @soboleffspaces As I read your introduction to diagnosis reasoning, I can't help by asking what the research question is. IOW, are we searching for a factor X that maximizes the causal effect of X on Y? Or, perhaps, one that maximizes the conditional probability P(x|y), or  PN, or PS of X on Y?
