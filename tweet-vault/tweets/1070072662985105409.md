@EpiEllie @eddericu @zshahn @_MiguelHernan Everyone distinguishes these two beasts in one's mind, as well as in practice. The question is do we distinguish them in the mathematical notation? e.g., in the research question that we write down? The current confusion would have been avoided by good notation. eg, do(x) vs. Y_x
