@yudapearl @HarryDCrane The structural modelling side of econ, I think, interprets “causal effect”  in a similar way to the do-operator. I did an SCM-pres, and a macroeconomist asked why I didn’t just define the causal effect of x as the partial derivative of the system w.r.t. the structural shock on x.
