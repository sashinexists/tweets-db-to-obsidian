@HL327 @stephensenn @soboleffspaces @yudapearl @ADAlthousePhD @JFronczekMD @EpiEllie @f2harrell @statsepi @GuyattGH @GRADE_WG Why do you say ATE refers to feedback? Is it because you think that y_0 and y_1 are actually measured at different times? Because that is not correct. The very point of ATE is that  if you measure y_0, you can never measure y_1,and vice versa. Counterfactual != feedback
