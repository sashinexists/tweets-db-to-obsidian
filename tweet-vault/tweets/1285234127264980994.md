9/N Thus, by modeling a joint probability with a graph, we can algorithmically derive the testable implications. If two graphs have the same implications, they cannot be distinguished from data alone. Sadly, a fork or a chain (in either direction) are observationally equivalent. https://t.co/1UcmHQ2If9
