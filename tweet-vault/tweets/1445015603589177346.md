Another breath-taking change, from 1928 to 2021. Nostalgic Netanya. I knew Netanya from day trips our school took in 1944-47 to her beautiful beaches, overlooked by steep cliffs. I also had a summer job there during college, conducting a youth choir.
Nostalgic and breath-taking. https://t.co/0QCyFt7sZV
