@WiringTheBrain @mpigliucci @BobbyAzarian @erikphoel @SMcfarnell @PsychToday @Sara_Imari @philipcball @danieldennett @skdh @SamHarrisOrg @bgreene @yudapearl Unfortunately it is useful instrumentally to anyone who wants to argue, implicitly, 'no action is ever free so there's no such thing as coercion, so it's OK for me to force you to do X'.

E.g. slavery apologists used this argument in the 'wage slave' trope, also used by Marxists.
