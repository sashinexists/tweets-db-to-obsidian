@yudapearl @HL327 @soboleffspaces @JFronczekMD @EpiEllie @f2harrell @ADAlthousePhD @artistexyz @statsepi @GuyattGH @GRADE_WG I don't think that trialists would agree that an "ideal" trial is representative. They would stress fairness instead. This is achievable. Being representative is not, if for no other reason than that patients to be treated are in the future to those who are studied.
