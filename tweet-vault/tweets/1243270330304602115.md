@totteh @yudapearl @rabois I'm late to this. Puzzled. At first pass, surely large n isn't in same business as randomization.

Large n good for moving from samples to population correlations, not for guarding against confounders. The latter's randomization's job.

Not that randomization's only tool  . . 1/2
