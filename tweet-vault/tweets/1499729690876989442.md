@ADAlthousePhD @stephensenn @f2harrell @soboleffspaces @SMuellerLab I am so glad you are no longer angry at me on this count. Now, at the risk of getting you angry again, note that things are different outside medicine. In e-commerce, you can randomly select customers to one ad or another. Same in social experiments. Angry again?
