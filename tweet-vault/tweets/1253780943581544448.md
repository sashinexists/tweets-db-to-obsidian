@PACESconsulting @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @autoregress @Jabaluck @HeerJeet My first sentence says that for decades Heckman's selection-bias correction was tied to strong parametric assumptions. Nothing wrong with it. But if we want to snap out of such assumptions we need the logic of non-parametric models. That logic was a "novelty",
highly undersold.
