@EngineerDiet @stephensenn @soboleffspaces @JFronczekMD @EpiEllie @f2harrell @ADAlthousePhD @artistexyz @statsepi @GuyattGH @GRADE_WG I am not familiar with acronyms such as "RTM-inducing selection thresholds", and I hate to speculate, b/c whenever I do, 12 trialists jump on me with indignation: You do not know about RCT.
You can help us by just explicating what "ideal RCT" means to you. One formula please.
