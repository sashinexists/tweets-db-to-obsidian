@Jabaluck @yudapearl @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal But they do exactly that, close off all backdoor paths to achieve identification. It would have been of course even better if they would have made all the assumptions that lead to backdoor admissibility explicit â€“ in a DAG. https://t.co/enRpm4TH7d
