I guess it's official now: In August I'll leave @umsbe and start a new position at the Strategy &amp; Innovation (@SI_Copenhagen) department of Copenhagen Business School. Looking forward to an exciting city, a stimulating research environment and many great new colleagues! ⏭️@CBScph https://t.co/fKBI93thNa
