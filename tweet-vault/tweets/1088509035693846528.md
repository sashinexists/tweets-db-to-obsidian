@JohannesTextor @yudapearl BTW - for what it’s worth, the ‘physical hierarchical’ modellers do actually semi-explicitly assume no confounding between Y and M: M is the ‘process’ variable and Y the ‘measurement’ variable and they assume the ‘measurement parameters’ (~ U etc into Y) are indep. of the process
