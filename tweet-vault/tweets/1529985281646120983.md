@hearNtalk @ShimonLevit @yudapearl @CNN I think the expectation of a news agency is to report news per available facts &amp; withhold reporting if sources aren't confirmed

A reporter needn't be a topic expert, but should be expert on getting corroborated facts

I'm happy to decide my own position if "facts" can be trusted
