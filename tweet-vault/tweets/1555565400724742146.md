@dlmillimet @instrumenthull @paulgp @pietrobiroli @yudapearl If you ask me it's not just philosophical but also a largely meaningless debate because it has no practical implications. So much ink spilled just because the early PO literature didn't have a better analogy than "target trials". But you're right, perhaps best discussed in a bar.
