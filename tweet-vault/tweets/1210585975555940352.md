@kudkudakpl @GaryMarcus @moultano Good question. What I mean by "mathematical impossibility" is w/o causal (extra-data) assumptions of some kind. The paper u cite makes such causal assumptions and the study of what assumptions are needed has been the central focus of CI research in the past 3 decades. #Bookofwhy
