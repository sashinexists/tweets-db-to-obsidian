@HannesMalmberg1 @autoregress @eliasbareinboim @juli_schuess @CarterPaddy I must repeat and repeat the CREDIBILITY aspect: It is not merely to "encourage formalization" (which is also the aim of PO, etal ) but to encourage formalization at the level where knowledge RESIDES, as opposed to a level where knowledge is transformed to appease ID-strategists
