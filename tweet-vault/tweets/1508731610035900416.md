@soboleffspaces @yudapearl @nickchk @Lizstuartdc @PWGTennant What makes a DAG causal is that its arrows are directed causally which is based on experimental/empirical knowledge. Nothing in the DAG structure will tell us directly whether a DAG is causal. Neither will observational data tell us how arrows should be directed to be causal.
