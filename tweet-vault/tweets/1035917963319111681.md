@KordingLab @alex__morley @dan_marinazzo @yudapearl But you only believe RDD delivers causal effects if you have v strong specific beliefs about the causal structure. To me: choosing study design==choosing which part of the structure you best understand, so you can identify using that bit, but acknowledge uncertainty re the rest.
