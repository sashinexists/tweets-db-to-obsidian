@yudapearl @jsusskin @LeCun A NN trained via RL does distinguish between actions causing an increase of reward and actions correlated with high reward precursor states, and a NN trained on interventional data would capture causal relationships. It depends how you deploy NNs, not on 'NNs can/can't do it'.
