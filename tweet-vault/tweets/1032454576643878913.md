@_MiguelHernan @rdpeng I specially love: "Enough with platitudes like "gaining insights" &amp; "extracting meaning". These were favorites of pre-causal statisticians. Many still fail to realize that "meaning" and "insights" have been transformed into formal questions and algorithmic answers #Bookofwhy
