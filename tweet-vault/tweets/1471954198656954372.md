@yudapearl @soboleffspaces @AndrewPGrieve @PavlosMsaouel @f2harrell @smueller @ChristosArgyrop I previously gave the example of daily consumption of (say) potatoes and bread being negatively correlated for given individuals (they get their calories one way or another) but the correlation over individuals being positive (some eat more than others).
