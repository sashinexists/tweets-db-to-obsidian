@yudapearl @litgenstein @tomdrabowicz reference for my commentary was "Philosophers of science are BEGINNING to take interest"and referred to the  development of an "Explanatory Sociology", see for example Abell, Boudon, Coleman, Diekmann, Goldthorpe, Hedstr√∂m, Hernes, Lindenberg, Opp, Swedberg, Ziegler among others.
