@Jacobb_Douglas @yudapearl @PHuenermund @MariaGlymour @autoregress But there is also an opposite error, which is that DAGs can tempt one to write overly complex models. "Design" is needed to find the simplest realistic DAG in a given context to identify causal effects. In my view, good design is the central problem in empirical work. (7/6)
