Great post! This is indeed a quote from the #Bookofwhy (p. 87) paraphrased and attributed to S. Karlin. Note, isn't it precisely what we are hearing from researchers locked into Big Data, ML, Deep Learning etc. "The answers are all in the data, including culture and evolution." https://t.co/O3XE88OkhG
