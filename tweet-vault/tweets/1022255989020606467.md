@yudapearl @eliasbareinboim @_MiguelHernan @aynumazi @Harvard @analisereal @robinsjami uses counterfactuals to define effect of x on y (like do-operator), uses tree graphs to represent beliefs about causal structure (like DAGs) and has a method for determining identifiability (like do-calculus). Is anything missing from this framework? If so, what?
