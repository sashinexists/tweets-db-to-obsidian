@Jabaluck @ho_ben @causalinf @Susan_Athey These "parametric" assumptions (eg monotonicity) are sometimes "more plausible" than exclusion assumptions, not necessarily "weaker". They can easily be incorporated into the DAG framework, using the same PO notation, which derives its logic from SCM semantics, #Bookofwhy p.276
