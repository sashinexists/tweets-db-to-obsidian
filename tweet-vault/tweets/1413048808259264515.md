It's a great honor for me to speak again at UAI, a conference which I used to attend regularly since 1985 https://t.co/EqCaQw7UA0, and which has changed significantly since. I hope to convince you that Uncertainty in AI is still about capturing &amp; amplifying human understanding. https://t.co/MUli1PT7Jz
