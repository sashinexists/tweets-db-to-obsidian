@SPilleron @MaartenvSmeden @ZachHopkinsMD @yudapearl When should we use statistical inference? Need for p-value or 95%CI and similar stuff?
When working with the entire population? No. Meaningless.?
When comparing non-randomized subgroups within a sample? I do not think so unless the ample is large and random from an universe
