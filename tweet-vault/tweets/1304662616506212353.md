On a personal note, I knew that Bahrain means it already in September of 2017, in Los Angeles, during a visit by Prince Nasser. To my total surprise, the Bahraini orchestra started playing Hatikvah; not the usual religious tunes, but Hatikvah. For me, that was IT! A done deal! https://t.co/l4QDmBUV6Q
