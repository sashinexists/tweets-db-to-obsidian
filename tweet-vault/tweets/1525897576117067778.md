@kailashbuki @icmlconf @AmazonScience @awscloud This is interesting. Outliers, indeed, evoke a demand for explanation more so than ordinary events like headaches and late flights. Is there an established statistical theory of outliers that should now be domesticated by counterfactuals, as graphs did to "missing data"?
