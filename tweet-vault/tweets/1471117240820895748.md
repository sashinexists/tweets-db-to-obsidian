@stephensenn @AndrewPGrieve @PavlosMsaouel @soboleffspaces @f2harrell @smueller @ChristosArgyrop Yes, this is indeed the only assumption underlying our analysis, ie, that the participants in both studies are selected randomly from THE SAME population. If the RCT suffers (as usual) from selection bias, the results should be modified to correct (if possible) for such bias.
