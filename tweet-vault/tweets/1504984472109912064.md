@soboleffspaces @yudapearl @ADAlthousePhD @artistexyz @stephensenn @JFronczekMD @EpiEllie @f2harrell @statsepi @GuyattGH @GRADE_WG My role has been to interpret RCTs in the context of my personal assumptions, patients’ needs &amp; available budgets using diagnoses &amp; estimations of absolute change of probabilities of various outcomes if I ‘DO’ different things.
