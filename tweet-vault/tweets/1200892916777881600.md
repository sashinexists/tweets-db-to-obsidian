I now realize that ML folks must be going through the same trauma. Armed with Logic and Probability, the two most powerful languages in science, they find it hard to believe that they cannot climb from Rung-1 to Rung-2 (&amp;-3) in the Ladder of Causation. It's a scandal. #Bookofwhy https://t.co/t8ctzMEcPG
