@eliasbareinboim 2/ However, if you can only think of a variable Z that lies on the arrow X----&gt;Y and
satisfy additional properties, I would be able to identify Q using Algorithm-1. Likewise, if you can only think of W that...using Algorithm-2. Thus, the model is refined as we go along.#Bookofwhy
