@MupdnW @Bernd_le_ @resilienceSci @pvisconbio @Leclere_David @pstoett I wish someone rewrites this wiki entry. I have never heard of a book that is "laying the foundations of the modern debate on causal inference". The writer tried so hard not to take sides that naive readers may take CI to be just one big "debate". #Bookofwhy
