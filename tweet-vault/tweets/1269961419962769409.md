Here is another proof that a country condemned for existing can't be dogmatic. 39 years ago today,  colleagues came to my office - indignant: How dare they do that? Unprovoked! etc. Yesterday I called my sister in Tel Aviv -- she and hers are alive! Optimistic. Worried about us! https://t.co/cayhwsR8G2
