@Jabaluck @yudapearl @yskout To be more specific, I looked at the Angirst/Imbens/Rubin 1996 paper. p.452: "men with low lottery numbers changed their educational plans...then the ER could be violated...through other channels". This is a structural equation/DAG argument. It is completely free of POs.
