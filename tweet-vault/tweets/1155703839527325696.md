@Lester_Domes @melb4886 @AdanZBecerra1 @stephensenn @WhitneyEpi @sherrirose @laura_tastic @PWGTennant @EpiEllie @AlexBroadbent @StatModeling @MaartenvSmeden @Lizstuartdc @JMichaelMcW @JohnRTMonsonMD Glad we are in agreement. I could never understand why certain folks, who are reluctant to learn causal inference, always excuse themselves with "we can do it in MLM". What is it in MLM that gives people the illusion that it can answer causal questions? #Bookofwhy
