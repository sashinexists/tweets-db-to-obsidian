@hearNtalk @TheAcsMan @ShimonLevit @CNN Good point. People often ask me: How can you judge a network, or a politician, or a colleague by what they think about Israel - a small corner in the global scene? My answer: It's small, but it's a corner I know very well, allowing me to tell where they get their knowledge from.
