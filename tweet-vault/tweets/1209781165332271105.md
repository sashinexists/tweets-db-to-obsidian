@yudapearl @basorot @LeCun I agree models can't be refuted w/ training data. But refutation doesn't require catastrophic failure. Think of Popper's "letting our hypotheses die in our stead." Of course, many of the models we intelligent agents use *were* tested -- by nat. selection -- in this grisly manner.
