@CsabaSzepesvari @eliasbareinboim @mendel_random I think by "assumptions are hidden" Elias (and me) tried to say that,  even if you declare 10 times that you "assume conditional ignorability" the assumptions are still hidden because no mortal can decide if they hold or not, even in toy problems. I have tested famous mortals too
