@dustinvtran @zacharylipton @CsabaSzepesvari @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @yudapearl @ShalitUri Rec systems: Sure, we can randomize the assign., get samples from P(Y|do(X)), and estimate E^[Y|do(X)]. Fundamentally, I think that if we assume away Fisherâ€™s random, Bernoulli could prove that the emp. E[Y | do(X)] -&gt; to the truth in the 18th cent.! Where is the causality here?
