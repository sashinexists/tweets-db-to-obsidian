Every time I read Quora I wonder: Do empirical economists in Angrist etal school consider themselves "model-based" or "model-free". Some say: "unlike statisticians, we use models". Others say: "unlike traditional econs, we are not tied to models". I wish someone would clarify. https://t.co/c0M0Ii3X1O
