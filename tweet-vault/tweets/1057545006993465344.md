@Chris_Auld @PHuenermund @HolgerSteinmetz I would add "almost everywhere" to the statement that overidentification tests are tests of instrument validity. Imagine two invalid IV's which are identical twins (ie each having the same direct effect on Y). I believe they would pass the overidentification test,  #Bookofwhy
