@yudapearl @artistexyz @causalinf @unifr I hope so! That's certainly a goal of the textbook to generate awareness about confounding and the implications of different sets of identifying assumptions. Testability is mentioned in some chapters (IV, DiD), but indeed, there is so far no general discussion on testability.
