@soboleffspaces @causalinf @EpiEllie Nice find. It lists the limitations of RCT, and the need for ITE but, for the life of me, I can't see how they estimated the latter. It seems they fitted observational data with a parametric SCM, which gives you all the counterfactuals you want, if you believe the SCM.
