@pash22 @ChristieMDChris @AleksiReito @yudapearl It's interesting rhetoric but in what sense would it be different to my saying, 'If our notions of causation had anything to do  with the causal calculus this would have been invented 500 years before Pearl' IMO we should learn from Pearl &amp; Fisher &amp; Nelder.
