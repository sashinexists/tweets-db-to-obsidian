@economeager @statsepi @Emma_C_Clarke There are also cultural differences in formalization. Epidemiologists prefer a heavily structured, fully formalized set of notation, rules, taxonomies of bias and error etc. Econ is much more wild west, in part due to a belief that strict formality isn't particularly useful.
