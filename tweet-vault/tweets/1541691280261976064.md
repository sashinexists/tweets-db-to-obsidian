@Martin_Kramer @MESA_1966 @DovWaxman Hard to believe my letter pushed UCLA to rescind its membership. I assume there were stronger oppressive and colonial forces behind the process, and no  trumpets, to avoid backlash. That should only encourage Israel Studies Centers at other  universities to try.
