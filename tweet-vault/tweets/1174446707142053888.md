@litgenstein @EsserHartmut @tomdrabowicz Certain ideas are surely new in that book, others are old. I am holding Hume (1739) and Mill (1843) in my hands(literally) and, for the life of me, I can't see how they could resolve Simpson's paradox or other puzzles. Could any pre-1990 philosopher? Why deny progress? #Bookofwhy
