@iwashyna @eliasbareinboim @EpiEllie @eddericu @Amy_Bohnert @Research_ICU @NEJM @_MiguelHernan The English language offers us many ways of expressing Y_x informally, so as to engage informal audience. For example, using counterfactuals: "what if X were x," or simply "how X affects Y". These linguistic utterances precede the RCT metaphor by 2000 years, see #Bookofwhy
