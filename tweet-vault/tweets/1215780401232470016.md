@DKedmey @yudapearl is it *fair* to say that the accused tried to 'defame' the accuser for "campaigning for women's rights"? It's true that the accused posted a negative article, and that the accuser campaigns for women's rights. But is it FAIR to say that THIS was the best explanatory causal link?
