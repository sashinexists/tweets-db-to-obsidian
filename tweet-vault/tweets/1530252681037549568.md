@AlexJohnLondon @yudapearl I am currently reading "The Book of Why", which is what I was referring to.   

However, in the past I did read @yudapearl's earlier book "Causality", but I didn't fully appreciate the points he made in that book until they were presented again so clearly in "The Book of Why."
