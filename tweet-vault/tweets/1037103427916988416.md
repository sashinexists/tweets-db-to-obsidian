GIGO means GIGO! That's what the wise men said when the calculator first came out. They forgot the other side of the coin: "KIKKKO means KIKKKO". "Knowledge In - Triple Knowledge Out." Always say KIKKKO, when you hear a wise man say GIGO. #Bookofwhy #causalinference #ecobookclub https://t.co/awG1Nka7n7
