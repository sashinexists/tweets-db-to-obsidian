Analysis is what tells you what confounders are relevant. Lacking tools for this analysis ("graphs are bad") Rubin recommended "think hard". Analysis means "Stop thinking so hard", let the mathematics think for you. U "think hard" only once, when you commit to a model. #Bookofwhy https://t.co/q77RMYSQ7o
