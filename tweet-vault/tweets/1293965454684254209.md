@jcsahnwaldt @The_RickMc Twain was not humoring when he wrote "we never saw a human being". He is describing the road from Jaffa to Jerusalem in 1867. Even Palestinian historians confirm his observation except, so they say, he should have climbed a few hills off the road to see the shrubs he missed.
