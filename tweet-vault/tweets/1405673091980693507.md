@la_cosgrove @seanjtaylor I use tweets of junior researchers, men &amp; women, to learn about the state of education in various fields. So, if someone says "IMO," I conclude that researchers are still hesitating to assert what should perhaps be assertible. Educational reform need then be considered.
