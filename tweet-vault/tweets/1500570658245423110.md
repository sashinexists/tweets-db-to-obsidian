@yudapearl @stephensenn @soboleffspaces @ADAlthousePhD @PavlosMsaouel @GustafRydevik @f2harrell If you enroll cohort to receive O (non-interventional), we lose comparability of A and O. Cohort receiving O know that they’re receiving standard or care. The counterfactual question we answer is: “what would Cohort A/B outcomes be like if they didn’t enroll into the study?”
