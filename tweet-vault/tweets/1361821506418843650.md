@Jabaluck @dmckenzie001 @jenniferdoleac @PHuenermund @causalinf Beautifully put. The reason a human can do this could be that he/she already has a DAG in mind and can see  incompatible with the one presented. AI can do it too.
But you imagine a mind with a different model in mind, broader than DAG that, supposedly, economist have. Show one.
