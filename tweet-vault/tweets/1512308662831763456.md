@yudapearl @oacarah @beate_ritz @UCLAFSPH DAG in 11/ is for bias analyses (assessed sensitivity to possible unmeasured V &amp; W): PSFDE is not identifiable if they're not measured. When V &amp; W available, I think it can be written as ΣmP(M |do(X = x))P(Y |do(M = m))=Σm,c,vP(M | x, c, v)Σx’,w(Y | m, x', c, v, w)P(x', c, v, w).
