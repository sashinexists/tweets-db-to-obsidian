@yudapearl @mehdirhasan a country that defines itself as belonging to a race or religious group is:

1) not a democracy

2) not a country in the modern sense

3) not a fulfillment of self-determination, which is only rational when based on geographic contiguity, &amp; not on racial or religious affiliation
