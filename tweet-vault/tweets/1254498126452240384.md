@autoregress @maximananyev @Jabaluck @eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @PACESconsulting @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @HeerJeet Yeah, not sure I follow either. This reads more like a testable implication in a subsample. For instance, if you know the instrument Z cannot affect D in a subpopulation, we would have Z  D--&gt;Y, thus Y _||_ Z, unless there are violations of the exclusion restriction/confounding.
