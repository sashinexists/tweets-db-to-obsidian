@DanielNevo @Jacobb_Douglas @PHuenermund Agree on "alleviated". But you do not need SWIGs for that task, an ordinary DAG can tell you all about d-separation and back-door tells you all about ignorability and, if you really need to, it shows it to you explicitly, see Causality p.343, https://t.co/lJA1AkUZLj, #Bookofwhy
