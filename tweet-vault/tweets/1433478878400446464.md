Definetti was another big influence on me. His 'Theory of Probability' came out when I was in grad school (as did Cox &amp; Hinkley 'Theoretical Statistics' for neo-Fisherian contrast). Thanks to Stephen Senn for reminding us of its major points &amp; passages (esp. those I'd forgotten)! https://t.co/30UOm8H83S
