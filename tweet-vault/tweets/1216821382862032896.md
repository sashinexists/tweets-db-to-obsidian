Reposting: I attended an @EinatWilf talk 1 yr ago which dovetailed perfectly with your slogan. When I mentioned it to her, while she hadn’t heard it before, she immediately agreed. So glad that you 2 have made ‘twitter contact’ to boost one another’s efforts towards lasting peace https://t.co/FOZB0IbhyS
