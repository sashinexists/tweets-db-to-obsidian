@SamuelJWeinberg @Ya3il8200 @blakeflayton @IfNotNowOrg We are not talking Hamas and Iran, but about eternal Palestinian vows, permeating all walks of life, meticulously monitored by Israelis, to eliminate Israel by all available means.
Given that this is what Israelis see, advising them how to defend themselves sounds a bit unfair.
