I was also surprised to find the context worse. Modern statisticians are so embarrassed by his text that some resist: No, he wan't one of the founders of statistics.
Some even told me: "Well, he was a socialist." Which proves that dogmas &amp; politics still rule science. #Bookofwhy https://t.co/vUh8dzkGyB
