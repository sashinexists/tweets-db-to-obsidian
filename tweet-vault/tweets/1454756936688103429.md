@richard_landes Love it! It explains why BDS cronies never stop chanting "apartheid, settler colonialism, brutal occupation, ethnic cleansing, baby killing..." they are merely training themselves to believe in slogans they know are false. It's not lying, just #SelfGoebling, &amp; should be forgiven.
