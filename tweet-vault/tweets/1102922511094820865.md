@yudapearl @generativist @visakanv @girlziplocked @analisereal I am not typical of Harvard culture. I’m a STEM minority from the developing world and I worked for several years before graduate school. I’m pretty far from a ‘Harvard man’. I would refer you people in the causal group like Ellie (@EpiEllie) and Miguel (@_MiguelHernan).
