@Jabaluck @yudapearl @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal And I don't think you're really engaging with mine. If no arrow can ever be known / proven, how can we have faith in tDAGs, where we need to make exactly the same kind of identifying assumptions? You're postulating a false dichotomy here. https://t.co/KMXiHz58V9
