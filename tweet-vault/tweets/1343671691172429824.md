@artistexyz @yudapearl @ShalitUri @VC31415 @CasualBrady …for some x. What I can prove is the following: given an id formula as a sum-product that works for positive dist., it continues to hold if each summand, in the form of P(y_1|y_{S_1})…P(y_k|y_{S_k}), is either 0 or P(y_{S_1}),…, P(y_{S_k}) are all positive… https://t.co/HhmuY95UGT
