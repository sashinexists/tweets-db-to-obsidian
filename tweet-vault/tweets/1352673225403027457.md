For readers who wrote to me that DC pundits are aware of @EinatWilf argument, please watch them regurgitating the slogan "2-states is the only..." as if they think 2-state is possible w/o "end of conflict". Who are they kidding? Why not sing: "end-of-conflict is the only..."? https://t.co/Dj6ZcNDGS8
