@autoregress @yudapearl @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @HeerJeet But if we just estimate the model that @yudapearl suggested, where we assume *with no justification at all* that nurses are randomizing conditional on observed symptoms, we don't really have an identification strategy, we have unjustified hope.
