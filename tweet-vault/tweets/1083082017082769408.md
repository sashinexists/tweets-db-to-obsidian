@PHuenermund @eliasbareinboim @heckmanequation Heckman loved the do-operator so much that he renamed it "fix-operator" and went on to praise "fix" and criticize "do". He forgot that the operator comes with the benefits of graphical models, and left economists hungry for transparent causal inference. https://t.co/Jf1SkgV3CK
