@dopamine_uptake @pierre_rochard @WhiteRabbitBTC @TheStalwart @100trillionUSD this model differs a bit from PlanB's original because I didn't discount the first million coins, and I used weekly s2f datapoints from issuance and supply figures (from @coinmetrics). because I don't have the 1m coin discount, this one implies a price of ~$70k after the halving
