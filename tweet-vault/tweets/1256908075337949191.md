@yudapearl @eliasbareinboim @yudapearl to the best of my knowledge, acting on the environment (intervention) yields a deterministic set of changes to the environment
The stochasticity lies in the inability to ground and perceive those changes, not the changes themselves. I don't see a problem with the do-op
