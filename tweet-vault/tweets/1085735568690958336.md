@Grady_Booch @IntuitMachine @tdietterich @GaryMarcus @RichardSocher @demishassabis We call this facility "causal modeling" and, miraculously, the model gives you both "what if I see x" and "what if I do x" from the same compact representation. (Not to mention "what if did x' instead of x"). It is really a miracle. #Bookofwhy
