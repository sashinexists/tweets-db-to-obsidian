@stephensenn @yudapearl Right, the expr. refers to the latter -- the total effect do(X1, X2) on the outcome set Y. Note: the discussion in the paper is about the non-parametric setting, so "statistical" interactions are automatically there, regardless of the query being marginal or joint interventions.
