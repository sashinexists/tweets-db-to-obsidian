@artistexyz @soboleffspaces @yudapearl @AndrewPGrieve @suiss70 @miquelporta @f2harrell As far as I know, both historically and during the current pandemic, weâ€™ve arrived at a conclusion that observational studies (not RCTs) missed the truth more often than the other way around. Confounding and data quality are major culpirts. Discrepancies raise suspicions though!
