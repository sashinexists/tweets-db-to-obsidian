@yudapearl @The_RickMc I'm not crying. I'm a bit sad though that you seem to misunderstand Rogen so badly. I'm not even a fan of his, I just don't think he's a liar or a bad person. In this Haaretz interview he tried to clarify a couple of things. https://t.co/8RadqdZhAq Audio: https://t.co/RYeivGgn3T https://t.co/hdd0OjMX2N
