@danijarh @osazuwa @robinc SCM's are not DAGs. They allow cycles, as long as each variable (say each of X and Y) are assigned one function which describes how each depends on all other variables -- a society of responders. See solutions to counterfactual problems in cyclic SCM, Causality p. 215-217.
