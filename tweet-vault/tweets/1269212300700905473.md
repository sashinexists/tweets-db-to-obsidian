@DrIanKellar @SGSmith_87 @mc_hankins @PWGTennant I am glad to have been a catalyst for the clash between Matthew and his students/friends but the idea of not knowing "what he was talking about" strikes me strange. If he was talking causal inference in 2004 he must have known what he was talking about.
