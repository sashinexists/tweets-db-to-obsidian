@HenningStrandin @ingorohlfing @causalinf @soboleffspaces @EpiEllie @nickchk This is what I mean by being "unclear". Woodward defines all his concepts in terms of the causal graph (me 2), but does not define what the absence of an arrow means in the graph. Zero change in distribution is the wrong interpretation of arrow absence.   https://t.co/uWbBz4OiNq
