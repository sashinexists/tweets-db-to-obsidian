@Stebbing_Heuer @regev_nir @BernieSanders My general philosophy is that every experience, however subjective, is a piece of information that should be integrated with other sources to forge theories. I don't know anyone among my colleagues who is not disgusted at the way @BernieSanders is selling his soul to angry voters
