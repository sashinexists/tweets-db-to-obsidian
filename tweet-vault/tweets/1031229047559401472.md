@thosjleeper @analisereal @yudapearl @maya_sen I like to quote Babbage (father of CS, 1864): "On 2 occasions I have been asked, "Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?". I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question"
