@zaffama @analisereal @CarlosCinelli If we agree on determinism, then all individuals in the equivalence class are perfect clones of each other. Far fetched? unrealistic? Only if we take units to be individuals, not if a "unit" includes "time of day" "location" etc; all details needed to ensure a unique outcome.
