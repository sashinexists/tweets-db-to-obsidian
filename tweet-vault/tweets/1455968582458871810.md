@yudapearl @cmirzayi I think you're talking about that + the rest of our scientific knowledge that can't be obtained from the study but that one encapsulates in the causal diagram. Sometimes that's implicit as in "we adjust for the usual confounders," but I agree that it's worth making it explicit.
