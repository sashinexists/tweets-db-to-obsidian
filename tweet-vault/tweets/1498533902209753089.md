@yudapearl @stephensenn There is a basic assumption that we know the true results, that is y &amp; y'

However, in trials we are measuring y or y', and that can introduce measurement error. 

we cannot assume the error will bias to zero, which is what the paper currently does. https://t.co/iBfTUoIy9u
