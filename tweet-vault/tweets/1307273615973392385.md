@diogo_pernes @CasualBrady X&lt;--&gt;W stands for X&lt;--C--&gt;W with C an unobserved variable. Some people call the mixture of directed and bi-directed edges "mixed model". But there is no need to proliferate terms when a bidirected edge is just a couple of directed edges and the middle node unobserved.
