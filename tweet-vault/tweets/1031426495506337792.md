@thosjleeper @eliasbareinboim @analisereal @maya_sen Our ability to define (race = black) has little to do with manipulation.
Suppose we make the term very very precise, say by requiring a spectral content of skin pigments. Now what? Would the sentence "The cup would not have shot him if only he was white" be more "well-define"?
