@yudapearl @artistexyz @ShalitUri @VC31415 @CasualBrady I think it can still be identifiable. Think about the graph for front-door (T-&gt;M-&gt;Y), with an observed confounder U. P(y|do(t)) can be identified via either front-door by ignoring U, or back-door by ignoring M. It could happen that P(t|u)=0, P(u)&gt;0 but the front-door is ok.
