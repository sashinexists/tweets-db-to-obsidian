@venkmurthy @raj_mehta @cecilejanssens @mendel_random @resourcefulco @drjohnm In footnote 3 here, @yudapearl maligns #exchangeability as “black-box language”. I agree, &amp; would place it in same category with #StrongIgnorability as “a convenient syntactic tool” and “a convenient way of formally assuming … without having to justify.”
