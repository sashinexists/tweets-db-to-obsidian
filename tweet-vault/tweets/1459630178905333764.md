@TaymAlsalti @yudapearl @DJMinded Imho, the Palestinians aren't stuck because they're uneducated dolts, but because they've constructed a vast story to explain their long suffering. To rethink their view of us, as I'm asking, is to rethink that story and risk losing its moral certainties and redemptive promise.
