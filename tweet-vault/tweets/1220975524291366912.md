@joedotfaith @LucyStats @yudapearl @causalinf Causal inference tells us whether b1 or b1' or something else is the best estimate of the causal effect of x1 on y IF - and this is key - our diagram of how everything is connected is correct.  This assumption is often phrased as "no unmeasured confounders."
