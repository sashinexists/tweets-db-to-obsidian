@yudapearl @EpiEllie @causalinferenc @_MiguelHernan I don't see any conflict here.

Judea, I think you're arguing that you can always obtain an average/summary causal effect.

Ellie &amp; Miguel I think you're saying "yes, but how useful is that value?"

You'll never resolve this argument because the latter is a pragmatic judgement.
