I've learned to mistrust people who tell me "we are working with 'X' behind the scene". Invariably, what they mean is: "We give X a cover for inaction and X give's us an appearance of action." @VP Harris should state PUBLICLY what Israel means to her. @MarkMellman @DavidHarrisAJC https://t.co/tIgASaloqQ
