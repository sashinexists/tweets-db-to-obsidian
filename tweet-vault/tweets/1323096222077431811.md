@mat_kelcey @animesh_garg @bschoelkopf @yudapearl The book I'm currently working on that accompanies the course at https://t.co/1dRV4l5eM0 is also very short like Primer. Should be done soonish and published at the end of 2021.

Title:
Introduction to Causal Inference
from a Machine Learning Perspective
