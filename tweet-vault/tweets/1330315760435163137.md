@yudapearl @AndrewPessin @EinatWilf Could you give an example of these dangerous anti-Zionists who aren't antisemitic? (Not my Satmar neighbour, I hope.) To me, the illegitimate anti-Zionists are precisely the antisemitic ones. "Zionophobes" suggests that they're crazy and so not responsible for their actions.
