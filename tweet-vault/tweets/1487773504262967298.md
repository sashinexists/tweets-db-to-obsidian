Say what you will about this visit: extravaganza, diplomatic-gesture, PR-show, etc,. but as one who grew up in an era when such a visit was inconceivable, I feel truly touched, even moved. And if our washing expert @jonathanliew decides it's "peace washing", I'd be doubly moved. https://t.co/qIhay4vdcF
