@EpiEllie @robertwplatt @zshahn @_MiguelHernan Sounds crisp, assuming readers understand what Rubin meant. Your note implies there are counterfactuals that are NOT potential outcomes, and they are "used", not "avoided". Next step is to welcome notational distinction between them, and you are ahead with do-calculus - Welcome!
