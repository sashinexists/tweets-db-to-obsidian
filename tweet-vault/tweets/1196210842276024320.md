@stephensenn @RonKenett @f2harrell @learnfromerror For AI-ers, "comes from experience" is not a sufficient answer, because experiential knowledge must reside in one's mind to be usable. Notice that, taking your description literally, a regression model is all we need to automate your thoughts. Not sure you would agree. #Bookofwhy
