@KordingLab @shansiddiqi @yudapearl Oh, I think @yudapearl is very clear--especially in "The Book of Why"--that he doesn't provide a definition of causation (see CH 1). One doesn't have to for progress on these topics.

However, many philosophers--Woodward, Hitchcock, etc.--rely on Pearl's work to do just this. https://t.co/6fzAKJ3b2x
