@stephensenn @ADAlthousePhD @f2harrell @soboleffspaces @SMuellerLab That "randomization is not random sampling" we can see in the equations with zero ambiguity. The less trivial thing we can see in the equation is that results from a non-representative sample, can be repaired as if it came from a representative sample. But this takes math.
