@PHuenermund @yudapearl @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal You keep saying there is a "ground truth" DAG for any specific question, but I don't think that matches the real world where any X and Y variable have thousands of potential correlates and we need to decide which to include in our DAG and which to codify as U's.
