Jamie Robins lecture on "Causal Inference without Randomized Experiments: How do we know that we are right?" should be of interest to readers of this educational channel. Especially given that (last I checked) Jamie &amp; @_MiguelHernan do not believe in the 1st Law. Worth attending. https://t.co/YyM195H7MD
