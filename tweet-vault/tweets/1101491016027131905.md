Paul, I agree with your observation. However the issue is not parametric vs. nonparametric as much as it is causal vs. associational. ML vocabulary (at least in 2019) is purely associational or predictive, while econometric parameters are causal, as you noted, residing  out of ML https://t.co/UC9kuejca1
