Congratulations! Julian, on co-winning the ASA "causality in statistical education Award", and sharing this interesting thread on how you entered CI from neighboring disciplines. I did not realize they selected winners in 2019. I hope you help others make the entry. #Bookofwhy https://t.co/SJiKkesVjY
