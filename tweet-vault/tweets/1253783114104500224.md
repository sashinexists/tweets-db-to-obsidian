@The_RickMc @PHuenermund @Jabaluck @quantadan @maximananyev 1/ This is an important point. What make us judge a treatment as "as-if random" when we have no coins nor lotteries? It is our subjective inability to conceive of a confounding mechanism. Take the price of beans in China and the traffic in LA. None is random.
