@siminaboca @cmirzayi My theory is that most statisticians are philosophers at heart, who choose this field out of genuine interest in how humans learn from data. However, once drugged by the data-centric thinking of stat-101, they remain handcuffed for life. Few manage to escape, eg Dennis Lindley.
