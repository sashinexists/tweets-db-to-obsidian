@DavidSFink @amitabhchandra2 @AdanZBecerra1 @yudapearl Iâ€™m confused. If I draw a DAG that shows A and B as confounders of the effect of treatment X on outcome Y, and I fit a linear model of Y on X, A, and B, then I have - by DAG - identified the causal effect of X on Y. End of story, right? #DAGisGOD
