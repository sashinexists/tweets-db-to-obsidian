@DKedmey @EinatWilf I was not familiar with  @DavidDeutsch pattern, probably because I grew up in Israel, with a firm conviction that all past patterns are a thing of the past -- the New Jew will put an end to irrationality and inhumanity. It is 2020, and I am anxious to study the "pattern". Thanks.
