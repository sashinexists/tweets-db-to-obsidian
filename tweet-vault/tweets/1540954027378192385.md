@lessc0de @NicoleCRust @shansiddiqi @KordingLab @josef_parvizi @foxmdphd Not sure I'd qualify as "the father of it all", but Iagree that, today, it's confusing to invoke "many approaches to causation" (eg Bradley Hill, Angrist and Pischke, LMN, others) when they all derive from one coherent framework, SCM, that defines their validity and limitations.
