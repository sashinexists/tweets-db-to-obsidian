Orwellian. But I don't believe President Pollack, a no-nonsense lady, would have approved of such stupidity. It tells more of how Wokism works: Some looney complains, a clerk gets scared of being accused of insensitivity, another hurries to his protection -- soon Lincoln is gone. https://t.co/32q3voLzWg
