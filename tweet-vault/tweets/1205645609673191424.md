@yudapearl Apparently late Fisher thought he was closer to Bayes than the Bayesians &amp; that Bayesâ€™ argument was essentially the fiducial argument. Others like Fraser and Bunke related the fiducial argument to what they called functional/structural models not unlike causal models. Eg https://t.co/Gc9aY55vC1
