This graphical criterion for selecting "best" covariates should be celebrated by my statistical mentors @stephensenn, @f2harrell,., because, even if statisticians knew it all in 1925, they certainly couldn't do it in their head. Can it be done in Nedler's calculus of experiments? https://t.co/dIOA2Bz903
