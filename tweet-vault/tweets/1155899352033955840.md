@fuzzydunlop123 @erinhengel @PHuenermund @yudapearl I want to know the impact of insurance on mortality. I observe in the data whether you are employed. Insurance status could impact employment, but it may also help to control for it to deal with the fact that poorer people are sicker regardless of insurance status.
