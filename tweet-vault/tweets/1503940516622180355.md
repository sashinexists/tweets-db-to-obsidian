@stephensenn @soboleffspaces @JFronczekMD @EpiEllie @f2harrell @ADAlthousePhD @artistexyz @statsepi @GuyattGH @GRADE_WG I truly do not know why you need us, CI folks? You have most trialists following your writings, we have none. Your theories are implemented and tested, ours are not. Do you want ask to consider problems you are having, or possibilities you haven't considered? How can we help?
