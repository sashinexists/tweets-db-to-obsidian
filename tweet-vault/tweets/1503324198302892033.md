@soboleffspaces @yudapearl @AndrewPGrieve @suiss70 @miquelporta I think I understood the difference when you and @artistexyz kindly explained this in the previous thread. My point was: if 3 limitations described by @yudapearl here https://t.co/le9ESM3kGE were removed, could I estimate P(benefit) instead of CATE using data from a single RCT?
