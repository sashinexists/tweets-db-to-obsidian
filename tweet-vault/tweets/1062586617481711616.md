@eliasbareinboim @Lizstuartdc @analisereal @ProfMattFox @yudapearl I think (but someone please correct me if Iâ€™m wrong), this refers to the specific estimate being valid for a given target, not whether one *could* generalize given the SD in question. I think the two papers use the term generalizable/transportable slightly differently.
