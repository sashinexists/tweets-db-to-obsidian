@dileeplearning @GaryMarcus @yudapearl Evolution of complex multicellular organisms is very slow, eg there have been only ~2000 human generations, and less than 100 million generations between us and the first mammals. Of these generational mutations, only a tiny fraction can have led to changes in brain architecture.
