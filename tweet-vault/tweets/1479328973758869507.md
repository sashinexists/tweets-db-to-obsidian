@_WEEXIAO @Vlad_S @drfeifei @GaryMarcus @yudapearl @tejasdkulkarni @neurobongo @TimKietzmann @demishassabis @sama @ilyasut @koraykv @AndrewYNg Love how you asked about default mode networks and the conversation immediately spiraled into symbols vs. gradient-based learning. 🤦🏻‍♂️ Should've asked maybe someone like @danilobzdok. 😉
