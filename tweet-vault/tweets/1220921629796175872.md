@yudapearl @nntaleb @HarryDCrane Mr. Pearl, with all due respect, I was trying to deal with “meaning” in the ordinary language sense of that word, because I had gained the impression that you and Mr. Taleb were misinterpreting each others’ use of terminology. I’m not asking to impose a statistical framework.
