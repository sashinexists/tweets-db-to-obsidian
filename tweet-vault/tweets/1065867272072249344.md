@eliasbareinboim @jasonhartford @dustinvtran @zacharylipton @CsabaSzepesvari @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @ShalitUri Is RL an exercise in causal inference? Of course! Albeit a restricted one. By deploying interventions in training, RL allows us to infer consequences of those interventions, but ONLY those interventions. A causal model is needed to go BEYOND, i.e., to actions not used in training
