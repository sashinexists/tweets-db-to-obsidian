@yudapearl @PooyanJamshidi No! Ok, so the preface underscores how difficult it was to develop a causal language, how simple English is poorly equipped for clarity, &amp; maybe a new language is needed! Yet the chapters turned out quite clearly written, page turning, &amp; not as logically convoluted as I'd feared.
