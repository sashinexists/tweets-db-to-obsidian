@gilled34 @mellifluousfuck @cest_leif This is exactly why I oppose to using antisemitism to calibrate how morally despicable anti-Zionism is. Zionophobia should be judged on its own demerits, its meaning is objective and has not changed over time: The Jewish people should remain in (or return to) statelessness.
