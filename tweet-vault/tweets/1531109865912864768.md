@UweSiebert9 @sadneurons @f2harrell @DrewLevy If "spurious correlations" may stand for anything that is useless, then we should not use the term "correlations". If I want to predict Y given X and I wrongly measure the correlation between Z and W, is that "spurious correlations" too? How about if I wrongly divide by 100?
