@yudapearl @optempirics @FatWhiteFamily How important is the "A"? The real world is kinda saturated with Control-Feedback DGs that are very much cyclic, right? Think there is a serious risk trying to express nature with naive DAGs, especially in causal inference, just because doing so is mathematically convenient.
