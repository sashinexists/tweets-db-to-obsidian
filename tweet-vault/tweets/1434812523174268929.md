@desai_pratik @bjorn_hogberg Simplicity is a language-dependent concept, so it plays only a minor role in explainability, see https://t.co/ILeBEP3rjT
Intuition is a more powerful force, and it is driven by analogies with the physical world in which our early experience is shaped, encoded and compiled.
