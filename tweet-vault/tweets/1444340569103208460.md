@LuisaBorrell @_MiguelHernan @NEJM Last time readers asked me: "What is target trial"?
I answered: "the  enterprise called "target trial" is based on the idea that if you try to emulate some RCT you would do better than trying to think about the underlying cause-effect relations." Is this still believed?
