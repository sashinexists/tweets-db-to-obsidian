@jodiecongirl @kareem_carr Thanks for elaborating. But this is the first I hear that statisticians care about "effects" and "interpretability" . I thought these notions are not part of statistics proper. E.g. is estimating likelihood of a disease, given a set of symptoms a "prediction" or "inference" task?
