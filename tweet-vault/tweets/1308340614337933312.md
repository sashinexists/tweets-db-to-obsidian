Excellent essay by Hussain Aboubkr, with one disturbing after thought. The Palestinian mystique that once mesmerized the Arab mind seems to be gaining a grip on European minds and US campuses. E.g., only one EU country sent representative to the WH peace ceremony. Inconceivable! https://t.co/8OzxqxF84g
