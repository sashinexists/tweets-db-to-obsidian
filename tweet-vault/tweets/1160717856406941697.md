@Chris_Auld @autoregress @steventberry @MariaGlymour @Jabaluck @IvanWerning @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas So, @Chris_Auld perhaps you can tell us in plain language what the sentence "Y=f(X,Z,U) is a reduced form equation" means to YOU, so I can tell my students how to communicate with economists. Let's forget MHE and ancient history. What does the label RF add? #Bookofwhy
