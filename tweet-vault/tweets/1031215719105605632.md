@thosjleeper @analisereal @yudapearl @maya_sen If 'race' is measured, and the perception matches the measurement, sure; otherwise, not sure what you’re suggesting. If it's that “race” doesn’t exist (or is unmeasured), how could then the effect exist? The effect of things that do exist in the world may be eval if measured.
