I am hearing great passion for ODE, so I ask myself: "Why not use ODE for causal inference?" One answer: We don't have the functions that make up ODE. All we have are some qualitative properties, eg. who are the arguments of each function, and we still venture to estimate effects https://t.co/F83mSCaiYn
