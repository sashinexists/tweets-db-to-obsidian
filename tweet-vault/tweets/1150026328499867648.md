@jack_bowdenjack @RobinGomila Sure, but this does not make the difference a "causal effect". What makes it a "causal effect" is the model and what the model says about the ignorability condition, which is here taken to hold apriori, thus assuming away the causal component of the problem. #Bookofwhy
