@eliasbareinboim @statwonk @yudapearl @PHuenermund Like I said HM is about model construction, which is perhaps a limitation. In a standard approach you would literally model each of these steps and piece together these in the correct order to make a generative model. Then you could directly simulate any intervention you want
