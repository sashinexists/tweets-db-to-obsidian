@Jabaluck @autoregress @MariaGlymour @PHuenermund @EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer @metrics52 Sorry @Jabaluck, these are not "toy problems", because they haunt each &amp; every IV exercise, albeit suppressed by practitioners to the mercy of intuition, so as to escape "struggle". Each one represents 10,000 "real world" problems in which "exclusion" is/was justified. #Bookofwhy
