@Chris_Auld @lewbel @causalinf @PHuenermund @econbookclub @steventberry @analisereal @jdramirezc @PhilHaile I see no practical harm in labeling some relationships "cause" and others "super-causes" to emphasize some perceived minor difference. Troubles begins if most causes of interest are in the "super" category, and journals reviewers start insisting on calling everything "super".
