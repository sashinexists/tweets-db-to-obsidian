@autoregress @yudapearl @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @HeerJeet This is where our econometrician friends from the 1990s can help. Maybe patients are as good as randomly assigned to nurses and some nurses prescribe more. Maybe nurses use a cut-off rule and we can do an RD. Maybe there are other natural experiments.
