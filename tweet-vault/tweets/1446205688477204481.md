@ben_golub @PHuenermund @yudapearl Let me see if I got this right: you're saying "SCM" means "structural causal model", and it is composed by structural equations that can be represented graphically using a DAG.

And you would say this is the more or less universally accepted definition of SCM in causal inference?
