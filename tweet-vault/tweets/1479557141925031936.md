@SAFECUNY @theamyalbertson I would go even further and, given the opportunity, would respond with surprise and indignation: "Don't tell me you are, God forbid, a Zionophobe". 
An Al-Jazeera reporter once asked me (in Doha): "Are you a Zionist?" My answer: "Aren't you? Isn't everybody?". He never recovered.
