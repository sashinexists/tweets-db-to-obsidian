@analisereal @eliasbareinboim @autoregress @yudapearl @PACESconsulting @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @HeerJeet I think maybe we're using backdoor and SOO to mean inconsistent things. I was using "backdoor" above to mean cases where we didn't really have a "design", but just tried to control for observables (although I get that formally IV, diff-in-diff, RD are all nested by backdoor).
