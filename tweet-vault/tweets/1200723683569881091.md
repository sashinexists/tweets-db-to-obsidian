@yudapearl @Lester_Domes @EpiEllie @ConiByera @LucyStats @AlexaYakubovich @AnjaLeist @rohitpojha @AbbyCScience @_MiguelHernan @casualinfer So determining Y(x) for one value is certainly part of the overall ‘causal apparatus’, you can’t use it to say ‘X causes Y’, assuming you stick with ‘X does not cause Y’ translates to ‘Y(x) is constant’
