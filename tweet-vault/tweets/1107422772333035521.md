@paulnovosad @yudapearl @analisereal You just agree with me then ;) (as long as your comment about paradigms is both positive and normative). I agree DAGs can be useful, especially pedagogically and that they might give rise to novel research designs. I'm just saying many (most) papers won't fundamentally change.
