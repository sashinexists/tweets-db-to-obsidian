@Jabaluck @maximananyev @yudapearl @PHuenermund I would be interested to investigate this claim (genuinely don’t know whether I agree).  I’d strongly recommend that it be studied in a subject-matter-context-specific way, though.  Clinical/pharma settings vs. social/public health settings may give different answers.
