@davidcnorrismd @cecilejanssens @mendel_random @resourcefulco @drjohnm Nah. Just because ergodicity may be violated over very long time scales doesn't mean we can't pretend over clinically relevant time scales.

Example: glass in your window is a liquid over millennia. Does that prevent a model relying on it behaving as a solid from being useful?
