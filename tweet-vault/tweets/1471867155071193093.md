@AndrewPGrieve @stephensenn @yudapearl @PavlosMsaouel @f2harrell @smueller @ChristosArgyrop We see events occurring together, but don't see causation. We reason both causation and covariation manifest as association. We rule out covariation by blocking all influences on putative cause in a real or thought experiment. Then we declare causation.
