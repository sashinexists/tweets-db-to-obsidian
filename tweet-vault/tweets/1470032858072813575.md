@stephensenn @f2harrell @soboleffspaces @AndrewPGrieve @PavlosMsaouel I am back to my bottom line: Do you think that:
(1) physicians were justified in trying to find a criterion based on counterfactual intuitions?
(2) We can fix today what they failed to do in 1980?
(3) The quantity 1/PNS plays a role in the fixing?
