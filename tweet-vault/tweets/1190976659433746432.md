@RDMetcalfe @jhaushofer @PHuenermund I might agree with you, once we explicate precisely what "all else equal" means. But I cannot agree on "because you better understand". "Understanding" was yesterday's excuse for inaction; today we can formalize and quantify whatever needs understanding. #Bookofwhy
