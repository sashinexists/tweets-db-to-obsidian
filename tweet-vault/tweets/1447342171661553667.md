@tadesouaiaia @desertcran @johndawkins @athie_gnome @gibletsMoon @rasmansa No reader of #Bookofwhy would ever say: "causation is not defined". Nor will a reader say:
"Some associations are meaningful wrt to manipulation, some are not." because the book 
tells us precisely which are and which are not.
