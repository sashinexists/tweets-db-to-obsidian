@KordingLab @fhuszar @tdietterich @zittrain @eliasbareinboim @suchisaria Everything Econs did is correct, but what they did is of limited scope. I once asked: how many economists can do X, or Y etc. and I lost all my econ friends. See Causality p.216 fn10 - I will not repeat this mistake - do not force me, please. #Bookofwhy
