The expression "causal effect" is a relic of a period when people (mostly stats.) thought there are "non-causal effects". I believe it was Don Rubin who insisted on the distinction. Today, when we understand that all "effects" are causal, "causal effect" is redundant poetry. https://t.co/f25LYehiCe
