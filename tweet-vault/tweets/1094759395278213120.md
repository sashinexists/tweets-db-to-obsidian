@KordingLab @djinnome @analisereal @manuelbaltieri #Bookofwhy is about causal MODELING. The course, as I read it, is about MODEL-BLIND methods. There is some overlap there, once we extract from the model all the information it can provide (e.g. estimability, testability) and we no longer need it.
What remains is statistics.
