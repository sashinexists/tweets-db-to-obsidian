@yudapearl @zacharylipton @eliasbareinboim @CsabaSzepesvari @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @ShalitUri You could argue, for example, that all we're doing is building richer parametric causal model classes. However, building models that can train and generalize from large data in practice is what makes them so interesting (i.e., causal inference with billions of observational data)
