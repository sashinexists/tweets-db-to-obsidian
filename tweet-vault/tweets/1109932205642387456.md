@analisereal @Jabaluck @convexify @paulnovosad @btshapir @eliasbareinboim Glad you emphasized "disciplining current ID strategies" which has been almost forgotten in the discussion, as if PO+IV+RC do not require formal assistance in visualizing, elaborating and strengthening the assumptions behind them. They do. #Bookofwhy
