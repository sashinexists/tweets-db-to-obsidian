@artistexyz @paul_snively @DavidDeutschOxf I once lamented thus: Probability function P is a powerful thing to have, it even tells us, on its own, how P ought to change when an observation X=x is received. Unfortunately, it does not have the power to tell us how P ought to change when an intervention do(X=x) is enacted.
