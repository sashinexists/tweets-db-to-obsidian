@eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @CsabaSzepesvari @mendel_random Reviewers regularly suggest confounders that may have been missed. This happens to literally every paper that uses ignorability.

Why is asserting a set of DAGs of size 1 qualitatively different from asserting a larger set that share a property? How many DAGs is too many?
