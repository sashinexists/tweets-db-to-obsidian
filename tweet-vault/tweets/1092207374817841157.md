I beg to differ. "Must be assigned a probability" is vacuous unless it is a commitment to obey the laws of probability after the assignment. Bayes' innovation was to translate "given that we know X" into "conditioned on X" as well as all the laws of conditioning #Bookofwhy p. 102 https://t.co/4LP33NUcDg
