@Jabaluck @autoregress @eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @juli_schuess @CarterPaddy And I think verbal reasoning + heuristics can be good. A draft lottery also makes sense in DAGs.

But if PO means people eschew formalization, it is bad for the same reasons that we left 1930s verbal economics (which was also impressive, and often correct in the new formalism).
