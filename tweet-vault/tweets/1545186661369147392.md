@shansiddiqi @ProfLaurenRoss @KordingLab If by "objective" you mean "based on data alone" we know it is impossible. If you mean "based on both experimental and non-experimental data" you are guilty of circularity, because you need it to "design effective intervention". The philosophers I read are guilty of the same.
