@m_clem @PHuenermund @nickchk @yudapearl If interest is on the average effect on the population E[Y(1) - Y(0)] then we compute the effect for Z =1, for Z =0, and take the (weighted) average. Since everything is binary, this could be done with a fully interacted regression Y ~ X*Z, then averaging over the observed Z.
