@AdanZBecerra1 @yudapearl @PHuenermund @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal Okay, unfortunately we've gotten way off base. I was making a claim about how to estimate causal effects. You're talking about a study where you assumed the causal effect was known and computed the consequences.
