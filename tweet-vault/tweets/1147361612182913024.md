@vijayant_k @Canadian_JACD @EpiEllie @_MiguelHernan But if BP is merely an indicator for some other risk, we should not see an arrow       going out of BP. But in all DAGs presented here we did see this arrow. Can you check with the experts? Still, the fact that we ask this question means that drawing such arrow make a difference.
