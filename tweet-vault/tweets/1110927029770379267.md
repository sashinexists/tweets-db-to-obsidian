@Jabaluck @yudapearl @yskout Your proposed test of the ER makes sense to me if I think in graphical terms and imagine that the ineligible population is ruled by do(draft = 0). Then I can verify the validity of the test in a minute. I would be surprised to see a derivation of this test using POs alone.
