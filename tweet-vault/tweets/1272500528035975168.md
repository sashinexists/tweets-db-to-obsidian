@ESteyerberg @tmorris_mrc @Crowther_MJ @f2harrell Agree. Collapsability is a statistical notion, see https://t.co/aC4YQMxI5b (insensitivity to conditioning), and has little to do with "causality" or "effects".(see Causality p.193). A tenuous connection emerges under the assumption of "stability" (p. 194)
