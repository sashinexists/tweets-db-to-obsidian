@TatThangVo1 @LauraBBalzer @eliasbareinboim @Megtron9 @Lizstuartdc @leskocar @EpidByDesign @_MiguelHernan @Carthica @herbps10 @LeontineAlkema 2/2 wondering though whether you think traditional meta-analysts (say S Normand) would feel more comfortable thinking "ignorability" or thinking "graph separation"? Traditionalists shun both, to their detriment, but the latter is more human. Awaiting to see feedback. #Bookofwhy
