I was one of those fortunate high school kids who studied geography from the 1st edition of Brower's Atlas (1950). Until then, the only Hebrew atlas we had was Jabotinsky &amp; Perlman (1923) where the world was 1/2 British and 1/2 French. Great to meet the man behind my geography. https://t.co/rDp5UHjN6g
