@omaclaren @unsorsodicorda This sounds exactly like CI. In which case can DE folks get the causal effect of X on Y, given data taken from Pr(X,Y,Z)  if the input is three unknown functions, x=f1(z,u1) y=f2(z,x,u2) z=f3(u2) and u1,u2,u3 are independent yet arbitrarily distributed random variables? How?
