The challenge in explaining "paradoxes" is not in showing that "there is no paradox" (surely life is consistent) but to explain why people perceive some phenomena as "paradoxical", and what assumptions create it. That's what #Bookofwhy does to Monty Hall, Simpson, Lord, and more. https://t.co/vUmzm45LaV
