@yudapearl @DanzigMD @Ilhan @RashidaTlaib @PeterBeinart I believe the point stands that it is complicated (there are legitimate criticisms of Israel and some who criticize them are, like your friend, inflammatory or choose words poorly etc) while David Duke and his ilk are not and using that comparison is inaccurate and inflammatory
