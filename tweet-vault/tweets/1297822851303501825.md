@dileeplearning @GaryMarcus @yudapearl Exactly. It took just ~300000 generations to get from chimps to humans (and beyond size, the brains are almost identical), but nature took 6M years. I find it implausible that we cannot do better: we know what capabilities we are looking for, and can try changes instantly.
