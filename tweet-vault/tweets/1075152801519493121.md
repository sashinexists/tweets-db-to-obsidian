@AlfredoMorabia @IntJObesity @_MiguelHernan @miquelporta @causalityblog "Let's use all the tools ..." said the Greeks. Then, when Hippasus of Metapontum proved that there are irrational numbers, they threw him overboard; they could not stomach their own logical tools. Can we accept the conclusions of our own assumptions? #Bookofwhy #causalinference
