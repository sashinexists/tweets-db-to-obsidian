@jonasobleser @dingding_peng @BrentWRoberts @jule_specht @sofievalk @jeremyfreese @yudapearl Still, if you cannot think of well-defined interventions for personality to estimate a treatment effect on outcome X, I am not sure what would be the (practical) point estimating a vague causal effect of personality on X.
