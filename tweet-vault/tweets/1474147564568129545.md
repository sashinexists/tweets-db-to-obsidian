@yudapearl @soboleffspaces @PavlosMsaouel @f2harrell @smueller @ChristosArgyrop @AndrewPGrieve @HL327 Clearly assumptions are needed. However 1) it makes no sense insisting on concurrent control (as in an RCT) unless control results vary from study to study 2) there is a lot of evidence showing they do vary 3) therefore assuming they donâ€™t is not very reasonable.
