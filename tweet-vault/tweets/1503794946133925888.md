@steventberry @yudapearl I'm a bit surprised by this so I clearly don't understand. I would've thought it's natural to think of a firm solving an optimization problem at a given level of the carbon tax, with the solution being Y(t) for tax rate t. Y(t) is some firm outcome variable (profits, pollution).
