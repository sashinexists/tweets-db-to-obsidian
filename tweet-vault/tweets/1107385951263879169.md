@eliasbareinboim @autoregress @yudapearl @CarterPaddy No one should ever write down a 100 variable DAG and do inference based on that. That would be an insane approach because the analysis would be totally impenetrable. Develop a research design where that 100 variable DAG trivially reduces to a familiar problem (e.g. IV!)
