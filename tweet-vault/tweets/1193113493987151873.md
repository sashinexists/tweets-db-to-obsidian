@renatrigiorese I'm not familiar with Khrennikov, and what I know
about de Finetti comes from others. i.e., Diaconis &amp; Skirms
 "Ten Great Ideas About Chance"declares de Finetti "the father of subjective Bayesianism"but I'm not convinced he could manage the "inevitable regret" problem. #Bookofwhy
