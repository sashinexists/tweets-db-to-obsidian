@KetchupEconomi1 @sterndavidi @causalinf There is no "pay to publish". How come so many economists miss my tweets that the fee is OPTIONAL.
I can't grasp the perception of "incentive to accept more papers". Are reviewers/editors paid in economics? Not so in JCI. Where do you get this perception from?
