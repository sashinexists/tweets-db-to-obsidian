@Jabaluck @yudapearl @causalinf @steventberry @paulgp @lewbel @Undercoverhist I do think it is a useful application of DAGs. It is amazing how thorough some of the investigations of exogeneity of treatment in many applied papers are.  But when it comes to whether the treatment is relevant to other samples, the discussion sometimes is so handwavy it hurts.
