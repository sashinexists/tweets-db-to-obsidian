@Prof_Livengood @yudapearl I think part of it is that Pearl typically restricts probability in statistics to observables only, eg below. Many Bayesians allow probabilities over whatever. Frequentists also accomodate via eg indexing by counterfactuals. So...seems to be about what languages are being spoken https://t.co/pUBtpY32eK
