@f2harrell @ADAlthousePhD @stephensenn @soboleffspaces @SMuellerLab So, in your judgement, RCT literature IS GUIDED by a formal framework? I'm willing to accept it, if you say: Yes. So far, I haven't received a Yes from anyone, and I havn't received an answer to the Q: what property is common to A and B that is different to A and O ?
