@yudapearl @deaneckles @aecoppock That exercise - which I labeled "fieldwork" - is not about looking at the DAG in front of you but trying to learn about what is missing from the DAG that could be useful for understanding the broader theoretical problem. Searching for a simpler, counterfactual DAG, if you will.
