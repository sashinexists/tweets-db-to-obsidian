@soboleffspaces @gottfriedmath @nickchk @Lizstuartdc @PWGTennant Trying to help clinical experts is tricky. They tell you that they think CRTs, but my suspicion is that they secretly think SCM. Ask them: "Assume you intervene on X, would adding interventions on Z make a difference on the distribution of Y?" See if they feel comfortable.
