@SlezakPeter @btselem @hrw There is no symmetry between a society that, despite its imperfections, is committed to "two homelands, equally legitimate and equally indigenous" and one that openly and consistently opposes the very idea of two homelands. @btselem and @hrw likewise ignore this asymmetry.
