@deaneckles @LuGram12 Is this connected to Aronow's book? Are you suggesting that pre-modern methodology (eg Angrist-Pischke) encapsulates wisdom that post-modern methods (eg Morgan-Winship) ignore? Or that social scientists are better off arguing without graphical models? Like PO folks? #Bookofwhy
