@yudapearl @jim_savage_ @Andrew___Baker @SueMarquezR @paulgp @jim_savage @jim_savage this seems reasonable to me. It could be informative. OTOH @yudapearl it’s clear some people think you may not have credited how stat/econometricians already make causal inferences. (I suspect there’s a mapping between your approach and others in widespread use.)
