@Jabaluck @PHuenermund @pablogerbas @juli_schuess @fuzzydunlop123 @autoregress @MariaGlymour @EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer @metrics52 You are again distorting my words, perhaps for realizing their truth. I never uttered the word "inferior". I said "suspect, for lack of ground truth". A doctor who insists on operating on patients w/o studying anatomy may be a great surgeon, but still highly suspect. #Bookofwhy
