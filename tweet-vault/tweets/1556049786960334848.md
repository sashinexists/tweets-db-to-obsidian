@instrumenthull @PHuenermund @paulgp @dlmillimet @pietrobiroli @yudapearl @eliasbareinboim @josh_t_dean @uhlily I want to see that very thin and very weak conceptualization of racism completely gone. I donâ€™t want to give it any air to breathe. Because I think as long as it is perceived of as a meaningful concept, it will maintain dominance.
