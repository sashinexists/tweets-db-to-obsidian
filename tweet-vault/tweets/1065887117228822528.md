@yudapearl @eliasbareinboim @jasonhartford @dustinvtran @zacharylipton @CsabaSzepesvari @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @ShalitUri My understanding is that causal models assume some nicely formatted knowledge of how certain variables behave, and then allows to query those. Isn't the assumed knowledge a different but in a way similarly restricting factor in terms of what we can practically infer?
