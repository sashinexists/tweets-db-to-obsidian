Elaborating: toy examples come with theoretical boundaries of what's doable, what's not doable and what must be measured or assumed to make things doable. By showing how your algorithms run on such an example, we learn if the'r aimed at expanding those boundaries, circumvent them https://t.co/ul4e3gDJNY
