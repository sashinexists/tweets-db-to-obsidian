@smilleralert @autoregress @Jabaluck @btshapir @diomavro I have never been a fan of the expression "can help think through things" but after seeing how it can be abused I pledged NEVER to use it as long as I live. DAGs actually compute what economists are struggling to THINK through. Analogy: algebra computes solutions, not help think.
