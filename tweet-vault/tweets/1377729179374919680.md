@PogrebnyakE @prem_k @eliasbareinboim @tdietterich @masud99r "Data Fusion" is what it says. You take data from here, and data from there and, because the sources are different, they provide two different views of reality so, as a result, you get more than the sum of the two components, provided that you know how to combine them properly.
