@_MiguelHernan @EpiEllie 1/2 This debate surfaces at least twice a year since Paul Holland's
announced his model-blind dictum (1986) "No causation 
without manipulation". I have defended a model-based position in
Causality (2009) Sections 11.4.3, 11.4.5, 11.4.6, and many more places.
To summarize:
2/2
