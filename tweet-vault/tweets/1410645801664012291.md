@yudapearl Theorem 1 in the paper identifies the ATE within the obs. sample which is the actual estimand of interest (my bad, see eqn (3.2)), so using your preferred terms (I think?), I believe it provides an "estimand," i.e. an expression for the "query" \tau^P_O in terms of observables? https://t.co/zMLsHw6WW3
