@dynamite_ai @agpatriota Good point. Except that we do not "Know" reality, only some of her features (eg symptoms do not cause diseases) and we are leveraging data to help quantify things we wish to know (eg. causal effects). It is not "inability" to do statistics, but a need to do what statistics can't.
