@Jabaluck @yudapearl @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal The fact that you think this would be different with PO methods, is because we've accepted loose standards for arguing verbally about ignorability, exogeneity and causal mechanism in our papers and seminars. This process is very opaque and prone to arguments by authority.
