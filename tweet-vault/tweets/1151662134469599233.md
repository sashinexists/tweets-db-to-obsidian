@djvanness @ConiByera @omaclaren @AndersHuitfeldt I tried to follow this thread, and still can't see what "logical interaction" you wish to represent. DAG in itself just says "there can be an interaction". SCM says more: it tells us the function Y=f(X,Z,U,W...). But I sense that you want more, what is it? and what for?#Bookofwhy
