@steventberry @lewbel @causalinf @PHuenermund @econbookclub @Chris_Auld @analisereal @jdramirezc @PhilHaile Interesting! I have two questions. (1) Is there an operation that preserves counterfactuals which differs from the identity operation? (2) Are these fundamental questions discussed someplace in the (accessible) econ literature? Has consensus been reached on some of them?
