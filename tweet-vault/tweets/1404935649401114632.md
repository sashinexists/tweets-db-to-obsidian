@DSA_Arrakis @yudapearl @Randomaleph @JoshMandelOhio @AdamMilstein You can try and erase the 10s of thousands of Israelis who have been protesting every week whilst ignoring the leaders of the other sides calls for global genocide. We're fighting for better leadership but you're demonising and conflation only bolsters the extremists. https://t.co/USapSgLpCk
