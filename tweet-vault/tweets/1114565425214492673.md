@HannesMalmberg1 @autoregress @eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @juli_schuess @CarterPaddy But the fraction of grad students who have a functional understanding of this proposition is far higher. In nearly all applied fields, grad students can't formally derive many operational principles they use. A better test: ask econ or epi/soc students to write a causal paper.
