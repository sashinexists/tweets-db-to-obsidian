@yudapearl in ch. 7 of #bookofwhy, you talk about necessary and sufficient causes. I've often wondered what the connection between causal DAGs and S/N causes are, esp. their visual representation, e.g. @ken_rothman's causal pies. Can the same information be portrayed in a DAG? https://t.co/3CWknz9Q4a
