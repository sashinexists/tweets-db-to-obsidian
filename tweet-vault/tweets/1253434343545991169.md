@yudapearl @autoregress @guilhermejd1 @analisereal @Chris_Auld @gelbach @HeerJeet I agree that more explicit structural models are often useful, which is why I frequently use them in my own work. I've especially found choice models useful. But the results follow from the (weak) shape restrictions in those models and so aren't derivable with DAGs.
