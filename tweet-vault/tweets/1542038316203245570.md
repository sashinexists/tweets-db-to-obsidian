@yudapearl @AleksanderMolak The paper that you wrote with Robins was the 1st to propose what is now referred to by the Chan cohort as a "g-formula" (GF). GF are just recursive definitions of a Bayesian Network. In  your paper with Robins, the GF defines a DAG with sequential backdoors. MTP uses a GF.
