@LoganLender @newzionists @EinatWilf @bariweiss @BenMFreeman @isaacdecastrog @blakeflayton Thank you for a thoughtful Tweet. I am sure many of us have asked ourselves same questions and have written about them here and there. It would be great to compile all questions and answers under one cover. A great project for @newzionists
