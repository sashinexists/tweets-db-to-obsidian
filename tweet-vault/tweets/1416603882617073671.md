When I was 6, the sight of community leaders, Rabbis, the town's mayor, my teachers etc sitting on a 5" bench, ashes on their foreheads, crying their hearts: Jerusalem! Oh, Jerusalem! was one of the most memorable sight of my youth. It made the fall of Jerusalem a short-term fall https://t.co/wkO2gvIJ2v
