@JaapAbbring @yudapearl @Chris_Auld @DonskerClass @lewbel @PhilHaile @steventberry I personally found SCM-style reasoning and language very helpful in a recent paper with Paul Schrimpf and Hiro Kasahara on Policy impacts on Covid-19.   One of the comments of the editor “can you state your assumptions more rigorously”. Looking at Judea’s writing helped.
