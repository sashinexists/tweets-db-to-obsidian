@yudapearl @overlordayn @trunghlt I understand this, but my point is that existing CI methods and formalisms assume that the high level variables such as Husky, Fur, Snow are assumed known. If they are known we can make higher rung assumptions, but what do we do if all we have are sensor measurements?
