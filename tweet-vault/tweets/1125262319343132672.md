@Doc_Yemen @aynumazi We both know that Hamas/Rashida want more than just "basic necessities". We both read the Hamas Charter (Israel destruction), and we know that Rashida can never say the word "co-existence."  We also know that Gazan can have all necessities were it not for what Hamas/Rashida want.
