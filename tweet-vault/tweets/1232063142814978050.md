@yudapearl @jim_savage_ @Jabaluck @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @MariaGlymour @autoregress It is good to be in agreement. For folks who self proclaim to do "structural work," and for Econ theorists, I don't think there is the confusion you suggest. For others, it is hard for me to plumb the confusion.
