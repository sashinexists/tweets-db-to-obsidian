@TheStalwart @dopamine_uptake @pierre_rochard @nic__carter @WhiteRabbitBTC @100trillionUSD @coinmetrics It is not exactly a mathematical dispute as it is a mathematical fact that one cannot define causal relations in the language of probabilities, nor can one claim causal relations without causal assumptions. The latter are missing from Granger's causality. #Bookofwhy
