Interesting observation. Except the 1948 abandonment of Israel was imposed by the U.N. while  the 2019 abandonment of the Kurds is Trump's doing. I always tell Chechoslovakian colleagues we will never forget what their rifles did for us, targets of the 1948 "momentous massacre". https://t.co/Te67FCSzcm
