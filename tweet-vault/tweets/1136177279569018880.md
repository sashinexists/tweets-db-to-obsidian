@jjz1600 Hi James, Excuse my innocence, but what exactly is wrong with the NYT AD? I was there, in 1948, and I can verify every sentence in the AD as factual and well documented. I would welcome the opportunity to tell you personally what Tlaib's ancestors did to mine. @DrMikeH49 https://t.co/yk0UagjSbK
