@smhall97 @alienelf @elanvb This is a beautiful paradox, thanks for reminding me. In my former life I solved it using Bayesian analysis. Today I would approach it as a causal problem and model the process by which the envelops are stuffed; the prob. of doubling A is not
1/2 but varies with A. #Bookofwhy
