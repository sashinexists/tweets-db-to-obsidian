@ProfMattFox @EpiEllie For freshmen class, I would use Ellenberg's "why my handsome dates are jerks?"
or the two coins experiment (#Bookofwhy Page 200). But for more advanced class I would ask: "How come it is so hard for us to come up with an example?" The answer is on page 199, Reichenbach dictum.
