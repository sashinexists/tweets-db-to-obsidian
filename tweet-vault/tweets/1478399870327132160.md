@Moshepupik1 @ShawnDreyfuss59 @blakeflayton @MairavZ @InnaVernikov @SAFECUNY @EinatWilf @Eve_Barlow @bariweiss @newzionists @zioness_lioness How else would you tell Peter Beinart (or @IfNotNowOrg) : "Even if you do not hate Jews or Judaism, even if you are Jewish yourself, even if you lay Tfillin twice a day, you are still morally deformed". This is what "Zionophobia" says and "antisemitism" does not.
