@RaniaKassi @yudapearl @EinatWilf @newzionists Israelis feel existential dread when the word colonialism comes up, because it means in their mind being deported “back” to Europe. When acknowledging that the US or Canada also share this label yet no one suggests deporting all Americans, it somewhat changes their perspective.
