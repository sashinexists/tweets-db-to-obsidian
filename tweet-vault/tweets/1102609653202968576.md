@kareem_carr @generativist @visakanv @girlziplocked Three comments:
1. I do not find SCM (Structural Causal Models) on your list. See eg #Bookofwhy
   Does SCM unify all the rest? (my school)
2. Are these schools independent of each other? Or nested within each other?
3. What are G-methods? Or, what is not a G-method?
