@adam_lynton @ylecun @ilyasut As far as I know we do not have an agreed Turing test for consciousness, except, of course, systems that act and communicate as though they have consciousness. Here, my faithful guideline is: faking it is having it, because it is practically impossible to fake w/o having.
