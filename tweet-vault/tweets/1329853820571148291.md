@deaneckles @PHuenermund @AndersHuitfeldt @yudapearl Hi D, not sure I understand your note. "Additional information" is always more restrictive *regardless* of having or not having the DAG (or being the true or untrue DAG). Also, more info always leads to more detailed results, partial or point identification. What is the subtlety?
