@artistexyz @AleksanderMolak I confess that I've never understood what g-formula is. Is it any truncated product of conditional probabilities? Or one that emanates from a specific graph (as in the do-operator). If the latter, how can you define it w/o a graph or an SCM? This I havn't been able to figure out.
