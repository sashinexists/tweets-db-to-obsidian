@steventberry @jim_savage_ @Jabaluck @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @MariaGlymour @autoregress It feels great to be in agreement: "The answer is: structural."
Perhaps you also share with me another conjecture, that much of the confusion in Econ emanates from not having a crisp, undisputed definition of Y_x, in terms of a (fully parametrized) structural model. #Bookofwhy
