My grandfather took me to Jerusalem when I was 3, I could not visit it again after 1948 (Arabs have funny definitions of "holy" "history" and "sharing"). I returned in 1967, my son was Bar Mitzva there, and every stone sings history to me. Happy Jerusalem Day - City of Magic. https://t.co/ObkPG5mC0w
