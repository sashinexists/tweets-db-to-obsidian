@analisereal @eliasbareinboim @autoregress @yudapearl @PACESconsulting @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @HeerJeet I agree that I wouldn't formally say the number of arrows you have to cross out *always* makes one strategy worse than another. Context matters of course. But in general, front-door seems harder to defend.
