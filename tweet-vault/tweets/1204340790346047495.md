@yudapearl @y2silence I completely agree. Use the simplest approach that works.  In principle though one could write a do expression for an individual, correct? Something like Pr(Y(u)=y | do(X(u)=x)). It is just that *typically* it is used in the context of a population, essentially averaging over u.
