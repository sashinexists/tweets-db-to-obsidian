What is wrong with explaining the data-fitting strategy of a model-blind fitter? I agree a causal approach is preferable in high-impact scenarios. But statistical models are ubiquitous in practice. Shouldn't we try to understand what they 'learned' *because* they're not causal? https://t.co/lZHDquYlNr
