@soccerdhg @EinatWilf For me the defining moment was when they attacked us from Gaza, after we pulled out, and the world blamed it on us. Remember the movement Yesh Gvul (there is a border)? The Palestinians will never agree to a border, and the rest of the world will support them, and blame it on us
