Correction: "but for" = PN (not PS). It just occurred to me, what does "Thank you" mean? A common word, said hundreds times a day. Conjecture: "Thank you" is ascribed to actions or situations that score high on the PN scale. Eg."If it wasn't for you, I would have been miserable" https://t.co/mwBPIXZuTv
