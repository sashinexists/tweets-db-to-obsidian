@lackboys3 @bennettjake1 @IlhanMN The way to test it is to donate "out of area" money to defeat @ilhaMN and see if it turns "shadowy &amp; dark". I just did. And I can't wait for the elation I'm going to feel when she is defeated. Just thinking about the possibility of such feeling is already worth the money.
