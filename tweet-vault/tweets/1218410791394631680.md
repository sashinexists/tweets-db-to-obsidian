@Andrew___Baker @PHuenermund @christopherruhm @causalinf The notion of "potential outcome" in the PO framework requires "treatment assignment" w/o which you cannot define Y_x. That is why PO folks are debating whether non-manipulative x (say an earthquake) can have counterfactuals -- the RCT roots are still strong &amp; stifling.#Bookofwhy
