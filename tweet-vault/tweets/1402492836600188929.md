@yudapearl @Observe89314530 @DrMikeH49 @surgeryontv @Eve_Barlow That has to do with Judaism as a religion - every religion has its holidays. 
As for the “me” and “we” conversation, answer me: wouldn’t we result in the dilution of Jewishness of the state and run contrary to Zionist ambitions? There’s no we in Zionism.
