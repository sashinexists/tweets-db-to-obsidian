@soboleffspaces @yudapearl @RWJE_BA Boris, I'm confused. Doesn't the interaction remove additivity restrictions and let data speak? Problem: once you start analysing higher-order interactions in finite datasets, the risk of modelling noise increases. Why would it be a disservice to find patients who benefit?
