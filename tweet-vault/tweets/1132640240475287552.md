@SamerAbdelnour @yudapearl @Vieroe @jvplive @Mondoweiss Take a minute to search who are the main sponsors of the UN. My god, you do need an oftalmologist. ALL UN resolutions lately are about Israel, no Venezuela, no Saudi, no Nigeria. Why? It would be interesting for u 2 give a read if what is happening in Yemen.
