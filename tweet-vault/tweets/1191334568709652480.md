Sharing a space-photo of Israel by lady astronaut (and Howard professor) Jessica Meir, who remembered her father's first country after escaping from Iraq. We can clearly see the Red Sea, the Sea of Galilee, and the Suez Canal. My biblical home town is there too, under the clouds. https://t.co/FvqbM3ABwk
