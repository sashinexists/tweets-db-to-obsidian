@yudapearl @artistexyz @causalinf @unifr In general, I think one cannot get used to it, it depends on the context, right? In stratified randomized trials (stratification on pre-treatment X) it appears credible, in other contexts, one should think about the causal models that possibly satisfy this assumption.
