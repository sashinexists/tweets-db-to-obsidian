I like your phrase: "we can read off ignorability from our models, rather than just assuming it", which tells PO folks what causal models can do for them. However, to ordinary folks I would say: "we can answer causal questions directly, skipping ignorability jargon altogether." https://t.co/LsqyV147T3
