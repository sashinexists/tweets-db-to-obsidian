@questionsin2014 @MatthewNLondon @PDeepdive @AishaAriella @BostonReview @MiriamElman @AMCHAInitiative @juliajassey @JewishonCampus_ I don't see a point in getting nervous at a convoluted account of a self-hating Jew who evidently went through some traumatic identity crisis and is now blaming it on Israel. My wife went through similar transitions and never stopped blessing Israel for restoring her dignity
