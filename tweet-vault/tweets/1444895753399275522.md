@HannesMalmberg1 @pablogerbas @instrumenthull @lewbel But what do we do with the "exclusion 
restriction"? Leave it unspecified? Further, if I go to a PO-statement, I lose all the beauty of do-calculus, with the help of which we get generalizations. We further loose testability. Can you tell if a set of PO statements is testable?
