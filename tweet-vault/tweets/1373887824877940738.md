@MariaGlymour @UCSF_Epibiostat @Megtron9 @EpidByDesign Where can we watch @Megtron9 show? Reading @Bookofwhy in Yosemite sounds like Rubaiyat: 

"Here with a  Loaf of Bread Beneath the Bough, 
A Flask of Wine, a Book of Verse, and Thou, 
Beside me, Singing in the Wilderness, 
And Wilderness is Paradise Enow.
