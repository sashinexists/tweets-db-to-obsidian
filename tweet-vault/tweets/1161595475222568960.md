@yudapearl @RonKenett #Bookofwhy shows convincingly in Fig 6.6 that causal action is at lower level &amp; correlation at higher level is misleading. However, it fails to note in Fig 6.9 that here action has taken place at higher level &amp; reverse applies. See  https://t.co/xRKxsRY0wU my comment 12 August
