@howardrgold1 @fcpsnews @Harvard What do you think your data proves? Harvard rejects qualified Asian students by making their entrance standards higher than other races. It’s a shame you fight anti-Semitism but can’t see anti-Asian policies. @yudapearl educated me on the Jewish scientists discriminated against.
