@alexdamour @yudapearl @CsabaSzepesvari @mendel_random The authors make an unfalsifiable statement about the effect of X on Y thr ignorability &amp; the suggestion is that reviewers need to find a better model to disprove the unfalsifiable statement. Did I get this right? Proving the science should be in the authors' side, not reviewers.
