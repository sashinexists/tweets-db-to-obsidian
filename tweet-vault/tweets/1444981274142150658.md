@stephensenn @ESteyerberg @LinkedIn @Lester_Domes @MariaGlymour @NP_Jewell I don't understand this universe. We have only two Halls, each has one and only one diet. Treatment =diet. Why complicate things? 

I'm not dismissing Nelder's calculus. I want to focus first on a simple version of Lord's Paradox. Can we?
