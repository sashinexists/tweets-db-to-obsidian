@stephensenn @venkmurthy @instrumenthull @soboleffspaces Every Instrumental Variable is predictive of outcome. Yet if we treat it like other covariates and adjust for it (as did Hirano and Imbens 2001) we will improve power, OK, but will also amplify bias, as explained here:  https://t.co/TA0mAJi5Ww
