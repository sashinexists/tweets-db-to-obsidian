An interesting thread that highlights a big difference between econ &amp; epi:

In epi, exogeneity is rare, so we have methods to estimate causal effects while accounting for confounders. In econ, it’s more common &amp; seems like the result is not knowing what to do when it fails.👇🏼 https://t.co/wLXrUXPPP9
