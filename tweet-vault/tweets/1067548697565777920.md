@yudapearl @junzhez @Abel_TorresM @eliasbareinboim @jasonhartford @dustinvtran @zacharylipton @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @ShalitUri 1/2 Andras Gyorgy (not on twitter) told me a good example (maybe @eliasbareinboim has already written a paper about this?): Imitation learning. Human does a demonstration, robot should copy. We don't have access to the sensory information of human. Details to be worked out:)
