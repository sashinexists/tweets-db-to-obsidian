Well put. Today, any administrator who agrees to meet to discuss antisemitism says, in effect, "Let me enter an endless debate as a cover  for inaction". Sincere administrators have the courage to name the disease: "Zionophobia". I hope @LordJohnMann does not fall for this trap. https://t.co/1mvCGjl82G
