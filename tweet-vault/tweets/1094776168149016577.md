@KordingLab @djinnome @analisereal @manuelbaltieri Model blind is not impossible if you assume auxiliary conditions (eg ignorability) that turn your statistical routines into causal estimators. If pressed hard, one can label these assumptions "a model", but then the causal story is gone, with all the fun of "seeing" it working.
