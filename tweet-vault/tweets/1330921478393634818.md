@Blattberg @yudapearl @AndrewPessin @EinatWilf nationals isn't what's agreed upon politically, it's what makes you part of a nation. in the US we share the same laws, the same 'civics' (albeit racism is institutionalized), an ethnic national state defines its nationals by their ethnicity, ethnic privilege is encoded into law.
