@LuGram12 @deaneckles I see a section devoted to causal inference, page 256, which is a welcome novelty for a statistics book. But I cant tell to what extent it covers the "causal revolution" ie, whether it stops at ignorability (1974-1983) or goes beyond. Perhaps @deaneckles can illuminate?#Bookofwhy
