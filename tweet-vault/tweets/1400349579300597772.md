It's not Google that is at fault, it is "diversity" that corrupts.  "Diversity professionals" see themselves qualified, if not obliged, to sort out other people by their ethnicity or culture and to rank them on a good/bad scale, deserving vs. undeserving of "diversity" benefits. https://t.co/e2OVLizDV4
