@fuzzydunlop123 @erinhengel @PHuenermund @yudapearl There is some U that impacts both insurance and mortality, say poverty. Poverty impacts insurance via whether you are employed. Hence, we'd like to control for it to close the backdoor path. Insurance can also impact employment, but controlling is lesser of two evils.
