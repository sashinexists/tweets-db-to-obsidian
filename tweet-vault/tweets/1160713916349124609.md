@steventberry @autoregress @MariaGlymour @Jabaluck @IvanWerning @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas So, if we agree that economists today are not clear on what is meant by RF equation, perhaps we should give them a few hints on how to explain RF when communicating with DAG-minded folks. Right now, they dont really know what the explanation should entail. Ready? #Bookofwhy
