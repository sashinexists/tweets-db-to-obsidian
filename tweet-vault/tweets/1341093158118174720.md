@sbuhai @yudapearl @JaapAbbring @Chris_Auld @DonskerClass @lewbel @PhilHaile @steventberry I think though “structural IO” would have a more focused definition (causal inference using economic models).  In understand though your definition as something encompasses both theory-grounded and more agnostic models for causal inference.
