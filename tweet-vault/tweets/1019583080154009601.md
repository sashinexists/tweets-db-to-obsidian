@rohitpojha @EpiEllie @mertrory I dont think determinism was/is the barrier. Children heard: "Watch the candle it can cause fire" for at least 1000 years.  Today's C-phobia stems from a linguistic deficiency in statistics, having failed to include "cause", or "do(x)", in its classical vocabulary. #bookofwhy
