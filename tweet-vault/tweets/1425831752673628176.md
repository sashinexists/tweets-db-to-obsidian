@EinatWilf @giladerdan1 @HolocaustMuseum I don't believe the @HolocaustMuseum depicts faithfully the role of Britain in preventing Jewish emigration to Eretz-Israel, not only in Haifa but all the way to the Danube River and the ports of Romania. And, of course, the role of the Mufti behind Britain's action.
