@eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @Jabaluck @CarterPaddy I don't pose that question in bad faith, for the record. I (like many econs, I'd think) would *love* to bring a new method like front door to a plausible setting if it means answering a question we couldn't before. Working towards that goal, together, seems much more productive
