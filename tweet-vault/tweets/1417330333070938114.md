@yudapearl Professor - Isn’t the morally objectionable aspect of BDS it’s failure to distinguish between the territories &amp; pre-‘67 Israel, &amp; the attempt to destroy the latter on the pretext of the former?

Isn’t a boycott focused on disputed territories different than one focused on pre-67?
