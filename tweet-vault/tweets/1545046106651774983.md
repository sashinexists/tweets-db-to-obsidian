@KordingLab @shansiddiqi Who in the causal inference lit provides a "definition of causation" that you cite?  Pearl doesn't define causation, right?  

There are actually few *mainstream* causality defns in phil.  In fact, one of the most prominent is *based on* the causal inference lit you appeal to..
