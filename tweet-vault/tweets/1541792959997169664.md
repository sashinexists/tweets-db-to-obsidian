Samantha, those who harassed you expect you to beg for protection. Try to address them as "Zionophobic racists" and see how they lose balance. Example: https://t.co/7jn0pnLspP.
Zionophobes are shocked when their ideology is examined as a moral deformity, by facts &amp; principles. https://t.co/Vcs3TaqxNP
