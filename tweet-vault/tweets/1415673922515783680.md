@yudapearl But Dr. Pearl, @Yale students (such as @fatmayasier) who hate Israel are *already* "educated"!!!

Not to mention, their minority ethnic identities render further research &amp; academic inquiry unnecessary! 

And suggesting they learn more before opening their mouths is RACIST. https://t.co/BM8rGiRvDF
