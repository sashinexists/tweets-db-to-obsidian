@KatieMollan @_MiguelHernan @yudapearl @Lizstuartdc You kind of nailed it with your hashtag - we can only see the outcome under one exposure for every person, so individual-level causal inference is hard/impossible. We could of course try to drill down by estimating effects conditional on many covariates (1/2)
