@BenHanowell @PHuenermund @eliasbareinboim Think about causes of effects at the individual level. Was it my aspiring that caused my headache to go away, today, at 3pm, after I watched that movie, and listened to Mozart's serenade? What if my plane had arrived on time, now that my partner is angry and the deal is off?
