@biosbenk @ildiazm @Lester_Domes @PavlosMsaouel @drjgauthier @yudapearl @kdpsinghlab @AleksiReito Absorbing outcome heterogeneity through covariate adjustment does make things better but you're right there are plenty of cases where fit is inadequate. A unified approach is to have a Bayesian prior on additional parameters that relax the PH assumption.
