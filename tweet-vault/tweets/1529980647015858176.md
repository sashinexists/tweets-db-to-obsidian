@TheAcsMan @ShimonLevit @yudapearl @CNN Imy expectation of a news agency is to put experts on each topic to report on that topic, so they should be fairly consistently objective on all. If they are good on some and bad on others, something is not right at management level, which unfortunately casts doubt on all reports
