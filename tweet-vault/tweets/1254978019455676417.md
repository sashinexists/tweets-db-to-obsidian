@autoregress @AlexChinco @analisereal @maximananyev @Jabaluck @eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @PACESconsulting @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @HeerJeet Thanks Alex and Peter for this discussion. Would this be an accurate DAG for the seating front-door example?

This DAG is for each pair of first-time Senators. Although it makes me think whether observed seat assignment is a proxy for the interaction between Senators? https://t.co/CiW9kkghvC
