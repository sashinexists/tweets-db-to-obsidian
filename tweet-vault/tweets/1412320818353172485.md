A shiny example from my corner of the wood. A colleague proposed a new Wikipedia entry on "Zionophobia" and was denied. Reason: Pearl is the main user of the term and he is not a "Middle East Expert". My plea: Urge you favorite "expert" to use it, side by side with Islamophobia. https://t.co/LjhD06JB84
