California wants to replace calculus with statistics and "data science"??? I'm a fan of teaching more statistics, but learning that at a meaningful, useful level is way, way, way harder than for calculus. And no, "data science" isn't that kind of a thing.  https://t.co/K17Mr3nQZ6 https://t.co/Wo2PVQAONC
