@yudapearl @thebadstats 1/ Great for them to listen, but youâ€™re not claiming to have reduced all real-world causal inference to a formal AI problem, are you? Coming up with a formal model (eg identifying the set of all possible confounders in the first place) is not itself a formalizable process.
