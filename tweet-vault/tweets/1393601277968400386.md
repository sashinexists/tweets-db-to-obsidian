@yudapearl @lauferlaw @IDF You spelled “might have” wrong.
There’s zero reason to extend any trust or positive presumptions.

(And no I’m NOT excusing the “other side’s” atrocities. Both are shameful unenlightened evil regimes idolizing violence and putting the whole world at risk. They need to grow up.)
