@PHuenermund @Jabaluck @quantadan @maximananyev And there is a good reason why justification is avoided. Justification boils down to saying: "I cannot think of any factor that would affect both X and Y." It is tabooed on 2 counts: (1) It's dreadfully subjective, (2) It invokes"factors affecting," almost like graphical criteria
