@aynumazi @JoshuaBernardNY @yudapearl @AOC @deborahlipstadt @bellingcat The article title is misleading. Israel's continuing it's probe.

Evidence points to a messy crossfire where intention can't sanely be found to the degree needed for criminal charges IN ANY CONCLUSION, so THAT'S all that's dropped for now. Times of Israel has the police statement
