@ildiazm @biosbenk @f2harrell @Lester_Domes @PavlosMsaouel @drjgauthier @yudapearl @kdpsinghlab @AleksiReito @tslumley By “problem” you mean Cox models w/ non-prop hazards? NP bayes analogues of standard freq. fixes like using time-varying effect/covariates or stratifying (similar to what i proposed above) have been constructed as well. Hazard modeling is an old problem in both paradigms.
