@TAH_Sci @statsepi @PWGTennant @ADAlthousePhD @stephensenn @f2harrell @soboleffspaces @SMuellerLab Can you point to a "fundamental challenge" posed to the idea of combining experimental and observational studies? So far we heard non-fundamental challenges of the type: "This is not how trials are done today". And it was far from "ignored" - a formal explication was requested.
