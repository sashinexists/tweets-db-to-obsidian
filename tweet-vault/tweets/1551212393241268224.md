@artistexyz @paul_snively @DavidDeutschOxf Note that the first slide starts with a do-operator,
which is not defined in probability theory. It requires a causal graph for its definition. Yes, Neyman-Rubin theory uses probability, as well as arithmetic, but this does not mean that the latter are sufficient.
