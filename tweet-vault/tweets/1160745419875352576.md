@yudapearl @autoregress @steventberry @MariaGlymour @Jabaluck @IvanWerning @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas I would suggest that you go with a slightly more formal treatment than my tweet!  You could explain that e.g. equation 3.46 in Causality is a ratio of two reduced forms, why each term is meaningful, and the ILS interpretation of that estimator.
