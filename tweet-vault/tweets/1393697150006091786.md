@analisereal @yudapearl @CarlosCinelli Assuming this is true, we’ll be talking only about equivalence classes of individuals so can we really say that we do inference for the specific individual? Alternatively, if it was false, then @yudapearl’s idea of enumerating the functions should be wrong, which I guess isn’t.
