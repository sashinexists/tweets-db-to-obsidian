@Meetasengupta @prem_k @butsandifs @kavita_anand @learning_pt I believe we can go a step beyond "try to narrow the gap", since we are in the age of causation, where "trying" is just not good enough. We can at least formalize when gaps are narrowable, what information is needed to narrow them, etc. We have the language to do it! #Bookofwhy
