@awhillas @EyalShay2 On the contrary, the media I consume paints Arabs as angelic victims, incapable of wrong doing. And if you come to my campus you can see where it comes from - they actually teach it in the History Dept. That's how
Zionophobes learn what media is watched by people they don't know.
