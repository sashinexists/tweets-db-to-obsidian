@eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @CsabaSzepesvari @mendel_random It's annoying when folks act as though DAGs are not only sufficient but also necessary for CI. This is false. Other approaches have good empirical track records. You can't deny this.

Win people over by solving new problems, not by disparaging their vocabulary/notation.
