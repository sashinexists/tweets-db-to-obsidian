@Jabaluck @yudapearl @fuzzydunlop123 @erinhengel @PHuenermund I have been to hundreds of applied econ presentations. I write papers in the "quasi-experimental" tradition. I do not think that _starting_ with a DAG can gain traction in the field rn since in all but very simple cases, people will challenge your every missing arrow.
