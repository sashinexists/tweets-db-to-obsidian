@Jabaluck @yudapearl @PHuenermund @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal I dont get it. The DAG tells me that treatment is a mediator between race and outcomes. Conditioning on treatment will artificially reduce the effect of race on outcomes. Thus I wouldn't adjust for treatment if I wanted to understand total effect of race
