@MisterSquirrel2 @LomaahhMore @maddalir @ShammaBoyarin @deborahlipstadt @IzaTabaro What's the point? That distancing ourselves from Israel should protect us? They (Zionophobes) disrespect Jews who trade their values for social acceptance, something they wouldn't do. They will never stop hating us just because "hate" is socially unacceptable.
