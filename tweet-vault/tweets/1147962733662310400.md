@yudapearl @PHuenermund @Jabaluck @EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer @autoregress Well, we can use prior beliefs or use evidence from testable implications of the model. Prior beliefs are often controversial. Testable implications alone can only prove the model false, not prove it's true. But the testable implications are underused &amp; often unrecognized in epi.
