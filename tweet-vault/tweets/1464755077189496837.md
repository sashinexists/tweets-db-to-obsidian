I wish I could join your excitement, but a book that starts and ends with Potential Outcomes would most likely deprive readers of three key elements of Causal Inference: Transparency, Identifiability and Testability. A glimpse at Martin's book tells me I was right. Wasn't I? https://t.co/P4TNAmMfvI
