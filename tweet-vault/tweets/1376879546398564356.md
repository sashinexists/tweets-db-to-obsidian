@neuro_data @KordingLab @BetsyOgburn @yudapearl Not a direct answer to your Q, but I try to stay away from "causality" per se and focus on "estimation of causal effects," which I find more relevant for policy and practice.  

But that's just where my interests are;  I just tend to be very practical.
