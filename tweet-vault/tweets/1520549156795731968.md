@ESMDcan123 @maria__cuellar Finally, we focus on a concrete claim where we differ. I claim that some observational data, if added to the RCT finding can prove that treatment causes "harm" to some individuals. You say: "Impossible".  I refer you to our paper  https://t.co/rGHIc9kH0O, top of p.4. Convinced?
