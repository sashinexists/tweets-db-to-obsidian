Alerting Jewish students among our followers: A serious mistake must have occurred on @ADL's website. @JStreetU is NOT "pro-Israel activists" but one of Israel's misguided defamers, assisting Zionophobic hostilities on campus. I hope @ADL correct this oversight. @JGreenblattADL. https://t.co/UERqeyocbX
