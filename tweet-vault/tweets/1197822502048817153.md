@yudapearl @adamdedwards Still think there is a difference between earthquake (in-manipulable but can cause things) &amp; race (in-manipulable, unsure that it causes things). Race &amp; other bio factors are associated with things but not causing them in my mental model. But will finish reading your book first.
