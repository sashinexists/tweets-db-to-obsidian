@learnfromerror @stephensenn @yudapearl From my recollection: To the first question, yes, it's clearer. To the second, the arrows are arrived at on the basis of theory, not the data. The data and tests based on it may support to the theory, indicate how theory may need to be revised, or diconfirm the theory/arrows.
