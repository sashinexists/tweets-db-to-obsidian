Very interesting! But can't we really account for path-dependence through side-effects. Surely my headache would depend on whether I take aspirin from my cabinet or go buy it from a North Korean pharmacy. But the difference should show up in M, if the latter option is serious. https://t.co/aiLr7Mxk4a
