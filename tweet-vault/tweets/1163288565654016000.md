A bit of history. The first BDS-style campaign started April 1, 1933, when the Nazi's boycotted Jewish businesses. It followed 3 years later, 1936, by the Palestinians, in their efforts to prevent European Jews from escaping - the most inhumane immigration policy in human history https://t.co/AlNNnSBMtA
