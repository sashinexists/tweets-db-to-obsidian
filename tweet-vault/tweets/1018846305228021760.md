@RandomlyWalking @f2harrell @eliasbareinboim Suppose asymptotic analysis reveals that the posterior of theta is equal to its prior in the limit of large n, would you still be running @f2harrell finite-sample exercise? Would you trust its next prediction? Would you dismiss asymptotics as "irrelevant"? #bookofwhy #epibookclub
