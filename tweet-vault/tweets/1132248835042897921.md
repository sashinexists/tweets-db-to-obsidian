@SamerAbdelnour @Vieroe Truth can be shocking, agree. But anyone who aspires to co-existence needs to examine the state of mind of both sides, including Israelis, 95% of whom believe they are under siege by, first, rejecting neighbors, second, 150,000 Hezbolla rockets, third, Iranian proxies, more?
