@EpiEllie @pietrobiroli @PHuenermund @instrumenthull @paulgp @dlmillimet @eliasbareinboim I couldn't find reference to "Natural Direct Effect" in this paper so, naturally, I couldn't see  why you find it "lacking of real world analogue."
Is it related to the old crave for "well defined interventions"??
