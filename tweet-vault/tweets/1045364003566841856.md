@cdsamii @juli_schuess @deaneckles @yudapearl I am not sure if you have this graph in mind, but it seems the quantity of interest is the effect of gender on salary, right? It's true that Gender is affected by certain genes, which in turn may affect the propensity for certain types of jobs, sure. Why would this be a problem? https://t.co/oMgCWwd23m
