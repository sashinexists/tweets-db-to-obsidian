@EpiEllie @iwashyna @yudapearl @eddericu @Amy_Bohnert @Research_ICU @NEJM @_MiguelHernan Assume we want to estimate quantity Q=P(Y_x) using data from an observational study P(Z, X, Y), where Z=covariates, X drug, Y outcome. If estimating Q is called "target trial", this sounds what folks have been calling causal inference for at least 30 years, no? What am I missing?
