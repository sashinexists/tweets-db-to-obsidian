@analisereal @yudapearl @CarlosCinelli Thanks Carlos, but I’m still confused. We can increase the cardinality of U as we like but we are still limited by the maximum number of functions it can index. Going beyond that, individuals corresponding to the same functions will be treated equal, won’t they?
