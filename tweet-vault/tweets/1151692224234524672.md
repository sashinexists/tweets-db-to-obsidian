@djvanness @ConiByera @omaclaren @AndersHuitfeldt If all you wish is P(Y|do(X=1)) then you do not need to account for Z. But you really wish to know more. You must start by telling the inference-engine what it is. Perhaps you seek the difference P(Y|do(X=1), Z=0) - P(Y|do(X=1), Z=1)? Or ratio? or something else? #Bookofwhy
