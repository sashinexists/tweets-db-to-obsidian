@Jabaluck @dmckenzie001 @jenniferdoleac @PHuenermund @causalinf So why is it so irritating to economists to accept that the reason they cross out umbrellas ---&gt; rain is because they have a DAG in mind that says Umbrellas&lt;--Clouds---&gt; Rain and, importantly, they also have a logical engine there, telling them: The two are incompatible.
