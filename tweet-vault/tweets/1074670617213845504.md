True, but in our lucky case we have both: (1) a beautiful formalism and (2) it can be easily applied to real-world scientific problems. I can't name any real world scientific problem that (1) HAS a solution and (2) escapes the beautiful formalism. Note the cap HAS. #Bookofwhy https://t.co/0pK3waEyR4
