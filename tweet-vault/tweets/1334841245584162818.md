@sbuhai @PhilHaile Dozens of well-intending economists are advising  me on how to interact with economists MORE CONSTRUCTIVELY. I am truly grateful. But, humble me, I come to learn, not to teach. All I am asking for is a definition of counterfactuals. Help anyone? @causalinf? @EconBookClub?@sbuhai?
