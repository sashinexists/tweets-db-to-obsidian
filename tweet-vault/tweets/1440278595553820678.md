@gilled34 @yudapearl @EinatWilf @newzionists Yes...when it was acceptable to describe it as colonial, it was described as such. Now colonialism is taboo and frowned upon, so they dont describe it as such. 

But that doesnt change the fact that it is a colonial project. Its exactly like other European settler colonies.
