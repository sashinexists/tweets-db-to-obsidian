@TomPepinsky @instrumenthull @PHuenermund @dlmillimet @paulgp @pietrobiroli Yes, because there is no back door path from race or gender to any other variable. However, recall that in discrimination cases we are usually interested in the direct effect (not the (total) causal effect) which is a counterfactual notion.
