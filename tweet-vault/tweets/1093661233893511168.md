@eddericu @EpiEllie @iwashyna @yudapearl @Amy_Bohnert @Research_ICU @NEJM @_MiguelHernan Well, X = one cig, 3 pack/ day, or whatever u feel is relevant to your population; Y = 5y, 10, 50y or whatever u like. So far, nothing new since each variable needs to be tied to some proposition in the real world. I don't think "target trial" = giving names to variables, is it?
