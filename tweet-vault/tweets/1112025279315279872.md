@PossebomVitor @causalinf @Jabaluck @yudapearl @nickchk Nonparametric IV is an ill posed problem. You have to invert an integral equation and you need conditions for that to be possible. The condition commonly invoked is called completeness, which is (almost) equivalent to saying it is identified because I assume it is.
