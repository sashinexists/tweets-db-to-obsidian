@maximananyev @Susan_Athey @joshgans I have a different theory on why epi. embrace DAGs and economists ban them; it
has nothing to do with the research problems in the two fields (the structures are
identical.) In the 1990's Epi was led by Greenland and Robins, and Econ. by disciples of Don Rubin. Simple.#Bookofwhy
