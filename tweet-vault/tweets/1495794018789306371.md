Karl Pearson--founder of mathematical statistics--in "The Grammar of Science" (1911)

He claims that talk of causation is "another fetish amidst the inscrutable arcana of even modern science"

Great discussion of Pearson--his work &amp; influence--in @yudapearl 's "The Book of Why" https://t.co/KuEptlaPmK
