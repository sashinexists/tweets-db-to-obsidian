@StableMarkets @RWJE_BA @yudapearl @stephensenn @ESMDcan123 @f2harrell @eliasbareinboim Well said. In the coarse distinction between statistical &amp; causal, NP Bayes clearly belongs in the former. Patient-specific inferences need the integration of both. The causal part that computer scientists need to familiarize with are the trial design nuances mentioned above.
