@artistexyz @VC31415 @PHuenermund @paulgp There must be some fundamental difference between "Research Design" and "Choice of model", else Rubin would not write "Design trumps Analysis" https://t.co/T6OFEeh3r9 (critiqued here https://t.co/NBqP9VrPOg) and seekers of "credibility" would not worship "design" over models.
