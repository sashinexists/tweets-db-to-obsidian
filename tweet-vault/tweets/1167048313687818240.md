@bwundervald @nickdaleburns @RduvalH @thosjleeper @mgaldino Good try, but the nonlinear function x3=x1*x2 makes the model nonlinear. It is not a matter of convention; it is substantive. In linear models, all causal effects are the same for all units (ie, all values of the error terms) We cant change this property by renaming. #Bookofwhy
