The most cheerful image of the week! Reminds me how we sang in kindergarten: Tu Bishvat Higiaa," and how we lined up, tiny shovels on our shoulders, to plant trees in the neighborhood. Friends tell me the ficus tree I plated 80 years ago is still standing, next to the barber shop https://t.co/IvVEjKgjPj
