@Jabaluck @autoregress @guilhermejd1 @analisereal @Chris_Auld @gelbach @HeerJeet I have a friend who "understands" the connection between independence and probabilities but he would never put the definition X||Y iff P(X,Y)=P(X)P(Y) on paper, or in words. His papers are full of X||Y and X||Y|Z sentences but no mention of P. His disciples claim he "understands"
