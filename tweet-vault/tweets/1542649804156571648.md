@AvrahamAdler @mishtal @benandjerry The malice comes from Anuradha Mittal. But @benandjerry remind me of so many Jewish American uncles, who just want to please everyone (including Mittal) as long as you dont ask them to study more carefully what's going on in ME, or what the Palestinians say about Israel's future.
