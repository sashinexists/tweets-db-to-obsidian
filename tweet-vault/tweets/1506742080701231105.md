@yudapearl @causalinf @nickchk That pa(X)→X needs to be causal is a new thought to me. It’s often assumed arrows indicate direct influence. But, that’s defined by the abstraction level: arrows represent direct influence w/o reference to underlying mechanisms. pa(X)→X can be due to their hidden common cause.
