@JoshMandelOhio @AdamMilstein My grandfather, Menachem Mendel Tauman was also from Kielce, same train, I am horrified to  imagine. But I am angrier at Democratic Reps who write letters to constituents (eg me) how great they are, and no word on where they were when Pelosi anointed Omar "a valuable member".
