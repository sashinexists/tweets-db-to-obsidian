@causalinf @Jabaluck @paulgp @autoregress @caisalinf, I beg to disagree on one tiny issue-PO. No amount of command over PO notation can make up for the (usually ignored) fact that PO is a derivative of structural models, as in https://t.co/Sf5yw328zl. Have you met a PO expert who can estimate Joe's would-be salary p.94 ?
