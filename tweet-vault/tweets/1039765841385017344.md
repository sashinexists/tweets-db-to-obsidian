@quantadan @JenMandelbaum Surely, all our models are  simplifications of our complex world. But there comes a point when we need to stop elaborating and submit a model to analysis. Would we be permitted at this point to draw an arrow from "race" to "hiring',keeping in mind everything said-written on it?
