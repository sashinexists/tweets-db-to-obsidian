@rationalexpec @stevenstrogatz @camelsincaves I had a quiet dinner with Clive Granger in Uppsala, Sweden, 1991. He confessed to me that he feels embarrassed by the name "Granger causality", since it has nothing to do with causality, but he can't stop people from using it; they need some way to express what is needed.
