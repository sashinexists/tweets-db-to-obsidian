@statsepi @PWGTennant @ADAlthousePhD @stephensenn @f2harrell @soboleffspaces @SMuellerLab Can't take the time? Unfair! It's been three days now that I am begging RCT experts to tell me what is common to A and B (which they judge to be "comparable") and different to A and O (which they  judge to be "incomparable"). Isn't "comparability" part of RCT basic vocabulary?
