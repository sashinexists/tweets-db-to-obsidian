@tadesouaiaia @desertcran @johndawkins @athie_gnome @gibletsMoon @rasmansa No need to feel low, some of the best statisticians have converted. I always admire Lindley who had the guts to admit it (See Causality ch. 11) 
But I am curious, what specifically you disagree with, and what kind of "description" would satisfy: "we hardly describe what it is."
