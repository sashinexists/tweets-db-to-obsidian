@avicenna @LuisaBorrell @_MiguelHernan @NEJM If it is "very much the same", why even mention RCT? If it is "first better than the second", show one "design" decision that is facilitated by the first. I'm not objecting to the latter, I'm just asking whether "many people know how" comes natural, or from programmed training?
