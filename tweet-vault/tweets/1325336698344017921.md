@ZoubinGhahrama1 @Corey_Yanofsky NN does not fit x--&gt;y or y--&gt;x, it fits pairs (X, Y) drawn from some distribution P(x,y). Now, since ANY P(x,y) can be generated by x--&gt;y as well as by y--&gt;x, there is no way of telling who the generator was, unless we make some assumptions on how (in)flexible the generator is.
