@yudapearl @aruncann @bugwonk @_MiguelHernan I think I get the idea here: the do-operator doesn't care how BP is changed. If the intervention that changes BP also direct effects on other vars, then those should be modeled. Given a model, you may or may not be able to measure the direct causal effect of BP.
