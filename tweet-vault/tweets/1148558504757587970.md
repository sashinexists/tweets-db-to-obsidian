@omaclaren @eliasbareinboim @stephensenn 3/3 definitely did not have the concept of "causal assumption", which is essential for every task of modern "causal inference." Going from RCT-data to "causal effect" is indeed a matter of data reduction, the causal part is already prepared for you in the design. #Bookofwhy
