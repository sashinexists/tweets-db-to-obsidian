@Andrew___Baker @PHuenermund @christopherruhm @causalinf Many authors are still using "as if randomized" instead of "unconfounded", and the whole enterprise called
"target trial" is based on the idea that if you try to emulate some RCT you would do better than trying to think about the underlying cause-effect relations. #Bookofwhy
