@joscani @eoteromuras @kamromero Wright became my hero after I understood what it means to tell the high priests of statistics: "Sorry, you have a terrible blind spot in your thinking". Now I wish the high priests of ML/DL would read Wright's rebuttal of Sam Karlin's "model-free approach" (#Bookofwhy p.88).
