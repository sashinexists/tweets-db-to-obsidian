@PHuenermund @yudapearl @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal Incidentally, you let @yudapearl off the hook once again. Interesting that while I can answer his homework problems, he is unable to even try to answer mine ("take this real-world causal effect of interest, then write down a DAG you actually believe in").
