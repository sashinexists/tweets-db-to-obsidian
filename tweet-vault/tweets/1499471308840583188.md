@ADAlthousePhD @stephensenn @f2harrell @soboleffspaces @SMuellerLab Please do not put words in my mouth. I would never say "my preferred notation". I asked whether there is ANY formal language that trialists use and, having learned there isn't any, I proposed the only one I know about, potential outcomes (augmented with DAGs). Care to switch?
