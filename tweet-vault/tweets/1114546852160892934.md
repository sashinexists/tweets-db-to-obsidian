@Jabaluck @autoregress @eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @juli_schuess @CarterPaddy The problems arise all the time (e.g., why control for common causes, but not mediators?). In PO, I think most of us cannot formally define and prove even these simple statements.

So the question is rather the value of formalization contra verbal reasoning + heuristics.
