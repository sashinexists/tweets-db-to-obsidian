@yudapearl @PHuenermund @Jabaluck @pablogerbas @juli_schuess @fuzzydunlop123 @MariaGlymour @EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer @metrics52 @eliasbareinboim I look forward to seeing more of your work in econ journals. I can't speak to the past, but the econ of today seems very willing to adapt new tools, if and when proved useful. For us, it's not "hey, look at this microscope" but "hey, look at what I *found* under this thing!"
