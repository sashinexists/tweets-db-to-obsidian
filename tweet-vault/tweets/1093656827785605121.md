@iwashyna @EpiEllie @yudapearl @eddericu @Amy_Bohnert @Research_ICU @NEJM @_MiguelHernan 1/2 I am still trying to understand the setting. (1) You seem to be saying that the task of identifying causal effects (Y_x) from observational data (P(Z, X, Y)) is better understood if one calls the PO Y_x by "target trial" &amp; don't use any formal notation?
