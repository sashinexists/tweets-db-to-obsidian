@Jabaluck @eliasbareinboim @autoregress @yudapearl @PACESconsulting @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @HeerJeet Ok, I think there is a way to unite these views. Most estimands will rely on SOO/IV types of arguments. For instance, front-door is a sequential application of SOO. Napkin is a ratio of SOO. Thus the building blocks to argue for exogeneity/SOO that economists have still needed.
