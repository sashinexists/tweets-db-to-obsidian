@DKedmey @DavidDeutschOxf Popper's philosophy, like others', factor into my ideas with a joy of invitation: Rejoyce! We can now model a "scientist's mind" on digital computer! Bring in your best ideas on induction, conjectures, explanation, refutation etc, load them on, send them to the field, and test!
