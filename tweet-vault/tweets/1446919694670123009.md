@PhilHaile @yudapearl You should be honest with Judea &amp; frankly tell him that hard questions from graduate students deliberating on how things are done are not welcome from professors -- hard questions are dismissed and ridiculed as "philosophy" &amp; "methodology", which are disreputable &amp; not "science".
