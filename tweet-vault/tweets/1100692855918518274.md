@stephensenn @deaneckles If Nelder defines his research problem and encodes his assumptions we can compare his solution to that of #Bookofwhy and decide if it is identical or elegant. But I doubt he can do that. Why? Because both problem and assumptions are causal, and Nelder did not speak causation.
