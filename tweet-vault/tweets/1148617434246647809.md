@pablogerbas @juli_schuess @PHuenermund @yudapearl @fuzzydunlop123 @autoregress @MariaGlymour @EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer @metrics52 What else would you have them do? They could write down a DAG where they pretend they know better exactly how these covariates relate to the treatment and outcome and estimate a complex model with those assumptions but why not do the easy check instead?
