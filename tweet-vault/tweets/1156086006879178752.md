@Jabaluck @yudapearl @fuzzydunlop123 @erinhengel @PHuenermund A potential solution that some people offer: Let's limit the sample only to those units for which we have long histories...   A simple DAG might clarify why this might be problematic and may not even address the problem. It may also suggest other ways to address this concern.
