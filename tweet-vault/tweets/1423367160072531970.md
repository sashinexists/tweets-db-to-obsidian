@yudapearl @ProfMattFox When judging conditional exchangeability, aren't you implicitly invoking the DAG? I love DAGs partly because I think everyone is working with a DAG in their mind when they evaluate assumptions like cond'l exchang. How else to evaluate it? It's less error-prone to draw the DAG.
