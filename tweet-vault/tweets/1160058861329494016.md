@IvanWerning @steventberry @Jabaluck @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @yudapearl @MariaGlymour @autoregress If one were to discard the modifier structural, how would one refer to an ordinary, purely probabilstic relationship stipulated betw RVs (say a linearity assumption on E(Y|X))?
We would have to say this isn't a model at all, no? This seems needlessly disruptive.
