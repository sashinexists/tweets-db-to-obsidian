@yudapearl @Jacobb_Douglas @PHuenermund Would your criticism towards "PO folks" is at least partially alleviated by using Single World Intervention Graphs (SWIGs)? It allows one to represent his assumptions on the world and then check using d-separation whether ignorability holds under this graph for a certain set X.
