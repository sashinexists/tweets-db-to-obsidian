In Rosenbaum's new book &lt;Observation &amp; Experiment&gt;, he asked, "Why do babies cry?" (p. 77). He then introduced an RCT that studied if rocking is effective in reducing crying. Thought his question is counterfactual (is hunger the cause of crying?) and cannot be answered by RCTs. https://t.co/Fd1Xv6Mxlg
