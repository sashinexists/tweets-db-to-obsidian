My opinion on @aaronecarroll article https://t.co/8sfvsfX4g6 is echoed here: https://t.co/B0TKO5MzlJ. Trialists and writers need to know that mathematical tools for managing and interpreting "pragmatic trials" are now available, hence they
can safely enter the folds of science. https://t.co/4mz2ep0ER3
