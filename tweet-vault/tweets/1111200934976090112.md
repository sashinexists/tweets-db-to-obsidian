@juli_schuess @PHuenermund @jim_savage_ @jim_savage, I am curious if you understand  how "credibility" can be attached this way. I'm truly curious, and would value your insight, because I have the feeling that  you did try to solve a problem with dags, so you know where PO's come from and why it is crucial. #Bookofwhy
