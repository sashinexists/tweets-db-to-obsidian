@holdmytowel @BEBischof Don't blame them. They couldn't ask causal questions b/c they didn't have a language to do so. Who you should blame? The stat professors who in 2021 still say: "We do not need special  vocabulary, it is all Bayesian statistics". They condemn Stat to another century of stagnation.
