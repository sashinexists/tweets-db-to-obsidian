To me, this discussion of OPE has reinforced the conviction that lots of confusion can be avoided if we describe a method by what it computes, not by how it does it. The former is a property of reality and, therefore, facilitates communication.
Some day, we'll all understand OPE. https://t.co/FyTByiLECf
