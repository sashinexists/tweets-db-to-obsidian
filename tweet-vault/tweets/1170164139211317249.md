@AdanZBecerra1 @yudapearl @PHuenermund @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal Okay, suppose your model tells you that if you equalized treatment between races, you would get no improvement in outcomes for minorities. Should we believe your result? In what way would the data look different if the opposite were true given your model?
