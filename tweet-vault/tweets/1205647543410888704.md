Personally, I have NOT encountered antisemitism, as confessed here https://t.co/kmSSC0gSU1. But my students HAVE, especially in dpts of History and Archaeology, shamefully mentioned in https://t.co/kmSSC0gSU1. It is the duty of every professor to expose those pockets of hate. https://t.co/tbX4Zlzp36
