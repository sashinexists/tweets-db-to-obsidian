@yudapearl @jsusskin @LeCun The goal of someone doing CI is likely to be different than the goal of someone fusing causality with DL though... Generally we aren't using DL for hypothesis testing or capturing the causal effect of variable pairs. It's for when we have 10k+ variables that don't factorize.
