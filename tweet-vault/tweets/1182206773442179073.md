@leskocar @andrearmolino @fledglingStat @davidcnorrismd Agree with @leskocar. The answer depends on what the regression model is used for, a question that tends to surprise most regression modelers. I once suggested that we should take the "model" out of "regression models" because they do not model anything. Do they? #Bookofwhy
