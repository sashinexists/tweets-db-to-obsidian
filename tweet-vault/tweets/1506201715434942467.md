So, how come I can listen to  Assad all day, and my stomach turns upside down when listen to @amnestyusa ?
Is it just the feeling that Assad truly believes in what he says? And that what he says is truly believed by millions and millions of his subjects -- Israel's neighbors. https://t.co/i8PxFj4EIH
