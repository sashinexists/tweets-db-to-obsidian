@dynamite_ai @learnfromerror @dataengines No frustration. You take the most "principled" null-test that stat can provide and you apply it n times, where n is the number of missing edges in the graph. Plus, this is NOT the most imp part of CI; what you do with the DAG is not less important, see https://t.co/BsNCQuIVuf
