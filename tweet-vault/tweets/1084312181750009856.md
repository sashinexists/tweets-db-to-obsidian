@omaclaren @statwonk @yudapearl @PHuenermund I am sure u aren't trying to obfuscate the thread, which Pearl is unrelated. We are talking about a task where P(S, T, C) is given &amp; we want to compute P(T | do(C)). We do not have access to the structural functions &amp; P(G) is unavailable. Is this a valid problem for HMs? Why?
