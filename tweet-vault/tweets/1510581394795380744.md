@venkmurthy @yudapearl @instrumenthull @soboleffspaces 1/2) There are two propensity scores
1) Theoretical based on the allocation algorithm (this is determined in an RCT, e.g. = 1/2)
2) Empirical based on the actual allocation. (Will randomly vary from, e.g. 1/2)
However, there is an argument for conditioning on what is known
