Glad you brought up Gelman's "sort of" review. I always recommend it colleagues who ask about causal thinking among leading statisticians in the 2nd decade of the 21st century. But, I reiterate, one toy example teaches us more about causation than 100 debates among the gurus. https://t.co/fIpQiwZTck
