@eliasbareinboim @autoregress @yudapearl @CarterPaddy ... to be clear, I have also said many times but I'll reiterate again: I absolutely think the work you and Judea do with DAGs is useful for certain types of problems. What I dispute is that explicit DAGs are necessary (or sufficient) for doing good causal empirical work.
