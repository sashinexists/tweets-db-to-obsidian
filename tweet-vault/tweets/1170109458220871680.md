@AdanZBecerra1 @yudapearl @PHuenermund @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal I think researchers should first settle on a "research design" --- find a quasi-experiment based on explicit randomization, IV, diff-in-diff, RD or some other well-understood assignment mechanism. Once they have this research design, they should build a DAG around that.
