@yudapearl @pablogerbas @instrumenthull @lewbel The classic example would be a random assignment Z-&gt;X, where we know that Z does not have a backdoor to Y, even though we are highly uncertain about the exact structure of the model. But you might argue that some other assignment principles have a similar feature.
