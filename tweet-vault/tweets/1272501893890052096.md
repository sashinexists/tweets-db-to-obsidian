@AndersHuitfeldt @ESteyerberg @tmorris_mrc @Crowther_MJ @f2harrell From what I know about non-parametric causal models, they are all about effect measures, in the sense that, combined with data, they allow you to compute any effect measure you wish. Collapsability, however, is purely statistical notion, defined by conditioning, not by do(x).
