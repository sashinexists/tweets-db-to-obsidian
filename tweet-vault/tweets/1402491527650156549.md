@cadillacmuzicc @Observe89314530 @DrMikeH49 @surgeryontv @Eve_Barlow Zionism has proven its "we" character on Nov. 29 1947, by accepting the UN partition plan. The Palestinian showed their "me"-ism same day, w/ "rivers of blood". Zionists offered to negotiate refugees return, but as citizens, not as enemies. Read the "War of Return" by @EinatWilf
