I am compelled to retweet your pleadings @RealSarahIdan, partly b/c you grew up across the street from where my wife did, in Baghdad, partly b/c you sang Hatikvah with me, loud and clear, in the SWU Conference, but mainly b/c the Iraqi people deserve freedom we take for granted. https://t.co/IzUnmWULfN
