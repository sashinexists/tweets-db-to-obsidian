@EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer @MariaGlymour @autoregress Applying the BDC without a natural experiment amounts to pretending that you understand *all* the variation in X (generally impossible) as opposed to understanding a small part of the variation in "X" (hard, but doable with sufficient care in many contexts).
