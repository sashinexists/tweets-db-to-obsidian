@symmo1969 @jeremycorbyn Beg to disagree. I've been following @jeremycorbyn since he became a Zionophobe. Israel is not an "invented nation" but a symbol of normalcy to its people, and Corbyn has expressed unqualified support to organizations who proclaim publicly their intention to eradicate Israel.
