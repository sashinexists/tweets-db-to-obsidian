@yudapearl @causalinf @jakewertz @Andrew___Baker @gelbach @CFCamerer @EricChyn @raulpacheco @mosenkis @Alan_Krueger @Econ_Sandy late to the game, but I'm quite baffled that so many of you would think economists were not concerned with causal inference before either Card/Krueger or before Haavelmo. That econs' way of hunting causes before that was speculative is a normative judgment, not a historical one
