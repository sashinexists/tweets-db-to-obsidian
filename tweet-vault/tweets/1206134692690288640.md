@mendel_random @stephensenn @QianYang_UOB @louise_millard The #Bookofwhy unveils several appearances of causal notions in the periphery of statistical analysis, it even celebrates with great fanfare David Cox's (1958) explicit expression "quite unaffected". Those peripheral sparks can now be made explicit and unleashed. R U unhappy?
