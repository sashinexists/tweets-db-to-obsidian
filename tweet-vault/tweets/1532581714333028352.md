Brilliant! This is the most convincing explanation I've heard. It does not lean on "antisemitism", not even a latent one, and it explains why Asian-American departments are the first to slander Israel as the source of absolute evil. We need to study the anatomy of "projection". https://t.co/XJ6sMjBghd
