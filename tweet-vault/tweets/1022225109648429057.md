Notation is only part of counterfactuals, semantics is no less important. The diagram is more than a visual aid; it DEFINES the do-operator. Without it I would not know what to cut and what to leave uncut. Without it I can't explain why tweaking the barometer will not stop rain. https://t.co/dbraFmkhIX
