@sean_welsh77 @David_Gunkel From practical AI viewpoint, faking it would be sufficient and extremely useful (and dangerous).
From a philosophical viewpoint, just saying "its more than just xyz" whenever xyz is less than an actual human being is not very interesting, unless  we hear what function is missing.
