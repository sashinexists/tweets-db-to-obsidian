I can't get over the expression on  AOC's face; how lovingly accepting, revering, respectful, approving and curious she is of a couple of Zionophobic nuts, dressed in Kaffias, praying for the end of Israel, with whom she hopes to fool Jewish voters. Motherly love, heavenly match. https://t.co/uVSCEBoKsr
