@PWGTennant @EpiEllie @causalinferenc @_MiguelHernan God forbid. What I can or cannot obtain has nothing to do with the meaning of an arrow coming out of BP, which simply says: someone is listening and responding to BP. I have not heard Ellie&amp;Miguel say "yes", perhaps b/c the notion of "Well-defined" is not well defined? #Bookofwhy
