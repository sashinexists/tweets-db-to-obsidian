@joedotfaith @LucyStats @yudapearl @causalinf Not exactly. A few important points to elaborate: when I'm talking about a hypothesis, I mean something more like a parameter in a linear model and that parameter is different - is a different hypothesis - in y = x1*b1 + e than in y = x1*b1' + x2*b2 + e'
