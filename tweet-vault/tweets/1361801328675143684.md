@yudapearl @dmckenzie001 @jenniferdoleac @PHuenermund @causalinf @yudapearl, I am not angry with you, just disappointed. You are simply incorrect. If humans can decide which arrows to cross out, so can AIs. It is not impossible, we just don't have the formal tools yet to do it, and you didn't solve the problem despite pretending otherwise.
