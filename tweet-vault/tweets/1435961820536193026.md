I disagree. The Pattern expressed by Taliban is not 'antisemitism' but Zionophobia. The same Pattern unveiled by UCLA department of Asian-American-Studies, whose members (my own colleagues) probably love Jews, as long as they are stateless, powerless, and at the mercy of others. https://t.co/ARpLNsrqYt
