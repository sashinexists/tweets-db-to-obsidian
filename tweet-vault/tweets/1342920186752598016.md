@VC31415 @CasualBrady Causal graph literature often makes a point of separating  statistical and causal domains, therefore usually working over distributions (~inf samples). Overlap is mostly a crucial issue to worry abt in finite samples, which is why IMO it doesn't feature prominently in CG writing.
