Explaining my preference: Ask a statistician about Simpson's paradox and you can tell right away how far she is on the road to causal inference. The majority just don't get it, even the gurus (see here: https://t.co/pvRNX7a71b), but the enlightened never go back to statistics. https://t.co/NauJjbE8ID
