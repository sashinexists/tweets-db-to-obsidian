@stephensenn @yudapearl Yes, but good points, thanks. 1) There's no common control, eg, see Fig. 1 in the ref. X1-X2 are two diff drugs w/ their own domains &amp; support.  2) We don't try to compare treatments (do(X1) vs do(X2)), but learn about their interactions &amp; magnitude when combined (ie, do(x1,x2)).
