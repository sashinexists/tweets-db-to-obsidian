@JimMinifie @jim_savage_ @Andrew___Baker @SueMarquezR @paulgp @jim_savage @JimMinifie I am not sure who those stat/econometricians are. Heckman ? Angrist? Imbens and Rubin? If the latters, I have related their work to SCM here:  https://t.co/Jf1SkgV3CK, I did not repeat it in #Bookofwhy (only in passing) because it would have sounded too negative.
