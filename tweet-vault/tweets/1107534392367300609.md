@maximananyev @Susan_Athey @joshgans Thanks for posting this discussion https://t.co/7hqs4REYtr  which illustrates nicely the M-bias which Rubin has denied since 2009  https://t.co/NBqP9VrPOg. Another thing I learned from it is that the word "design" is used for "data generating model" (ie., SEM). Good to remember.
