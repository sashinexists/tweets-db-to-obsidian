@robertwplatt @rohitpojha @EpiEllie @AbbyCScience @Lester_Domes @_MiguelHernan @casualinfer I read the literature and I acknowledge that many find it helpful as a way of thinking. The answer I do not get is "What is it?" New or old, what is the idea? Is each of my aspirin questions legitimate though it invokes no comparison, no trial and no randomization? #Bookofwhy
