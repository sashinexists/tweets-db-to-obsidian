The article you posted realizes that data analysts need to: "understand the data from a wholly new perspective". Fortunately, this realization is taking place while the field is still young, so re-thinking will be less traumatic than, say, statistics or economics. Hope!#Bookofwhy https://t.co/9rUgymTePH
