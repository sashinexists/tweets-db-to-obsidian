@AnjaLeist @use_me_research @drehkopf @stephanebordas I am wondering why you chose this taxonomy instead of the 3-level Ladder of Causation (e.g., #Bookofwhy). I think the distinction between what can and what cannot be estimated from experimental studies on populations is extremely  important in health and social sciences.
