@steventberry @jmwooldridge added tools, algorithms or insight?  I have seen those flowing one way: from SEM to PO, not the other way around. Calling y "potential outcome" serves only social function: assuring the PO priests that you still pledge allegiance to the PO flag, and haven't defected to SEM camp.
