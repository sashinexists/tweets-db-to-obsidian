@thosjleeper @causalinf My diagnosis for this reasoning is that, currently, Economists and Poli Sci are not being taught causal modeling. Instead they are being taught "ID strategies". So instead of adjusting the model to their problem, they adjust their problem to the model (a specific ID strategy).
