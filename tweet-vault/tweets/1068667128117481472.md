@alexdamour @eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @CsabaSzepesvari @mendel_random Alex, have you heard of Fisher's maxim "make your theories elaborate"? Also, there's a big difference in (1) assuming what you need from the start (ignorability); and (2) making credible assumptions and checking what you can infer from them (point identification, bounds, etc).
