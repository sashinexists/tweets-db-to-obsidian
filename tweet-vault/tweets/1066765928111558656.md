@yudapearl @eliasbareinboim @Abel_TorresM @jasonhartford @dustinvtran @zacharylipton @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @ShalitUri If by "RL is CI" you mean you can't do RL without some sort of CI, we are on the same page. But mainstream RL uses very simple forms of CI only, so I think we still need to wait a bit to see an impact of "fancy" (nontrivial) CI, but this is not to discourage your students!
