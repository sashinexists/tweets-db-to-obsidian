@wagonomics @amitabhchandra2 I hold fellow economists to a higher esteem. I know they do not need a minimum-wage example to recognize the importance, in their own research, of mediation analysis and external validity. Yet it would not occur to them that other fields are already 10 years ahead in these tasks.
