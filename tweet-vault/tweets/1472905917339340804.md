Palestinians know the soldiers will not touch them as long as they don't get violent. They know that Israeli security professionals are not going to hurt them. 

They would be equally brave to confront a soda bottle, or their own brother wearing a uniform he was told to wear. https://t.co/e6yEjSP1TK
