@LahavHarkov @IzaTabaro When you tell BLM folks "all lives matter" they hit the roof, like u wished them death. This week, condemning Islamophobia together with antisemitism belittles both. It would be acceptable if the latter was replaced by Zionophobia, a word @AyannaPressley is incapable of uttering.
