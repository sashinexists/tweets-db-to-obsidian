@AndreaSaltelli @RonKenett @fhuszar I have read your Nature paper with great interest, yet it is not clear to me where "causal models" reside? In the statistical or mathematical category? My taxonomy of models (Ladder of Causation) is based on what language  the assumptions must be expressed. Thoughts? #Bookofwhy
