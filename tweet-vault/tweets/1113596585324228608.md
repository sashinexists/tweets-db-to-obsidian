@autoregress @yudapearl @Jabaluck It also helps show why there may be an issue with the front-door here, say vs. the the backdoor. Say there are two "crime registries" that employers use. Z1 and Z2. You as the empirical researcher only observe Z1. I think then, your frontdoor estimate would be wrong, right?
