@nicidob @TradeandMoney I could not let this phrase pass w/o a comment: "a pretty standard regression analysis. It's causal in that the coefficients show predictive power". Now I do not know where to begin. Perhaps here @Bookofwhy? Perhaps Wright (1920)? Perhaps the "microscope" https://t.co/gNBNP7HuWZ?
