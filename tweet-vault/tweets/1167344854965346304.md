@analisereal @yudapearl @thosjleeper @DanielNevo @ildiazm @mgaldino I donâ€™t get why this model has homogeneous effects. The marginal effect of X on Y depends on the level of X, so in my understanding the effect would be heterogeneous (i.e. not the same for everyone in the population). Could you explain? Thanks!
