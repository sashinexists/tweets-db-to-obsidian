@analisereal @yudapearl @eliasbareinboim @_MiguelHernan @aynumazi @Harvard @robinsjami I personally cannot do that. Nobody denies DAGs are more user friendly than tree graphs, Jamie teaches his students DAGs. But he got the right identifying formula for some very hard problems, and has shown isomorphism between NPSEM/FFRCISTG.  I see no reason to doubt they work.
