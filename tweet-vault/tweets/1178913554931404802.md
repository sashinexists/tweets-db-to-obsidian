@Jabaluck @amitabhchandra2 No one is safe from bad assumptions - we are all humans. But making a bad assumption that is explicitly stated and can be communicated and repaired is better than concealing one's assumptions under cryptic names. I havn't mentioned "economists"-I know the sensitivities.#Bookofwhy
