@aynumazi @yudapearl @AOC @deborahlipstadt They're not the same but she's still being really irresponsible. There's no rational justification for her to declare she's certain Israeli soldiers killed Abu Akleh when there's a process happening. US reps have a responsibility-and it's not to render summary judgement in crime.
