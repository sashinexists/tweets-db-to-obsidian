"Causal inference" is benign, it goes from causal assumptions to causal conclusions, never claiming to "infer causality" from naked data. Making this explicit, and justifying some of the assumptions, should cure editors allergy. Mentioning the "causal revolution" might also help. https://t.co/f2AdzjKu1m
