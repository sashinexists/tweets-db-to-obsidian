@statwonk @omaclaren @yudapearl @PHuenermund Well, the main challenge of the example stems from our inability to performing an experiment that randomizes smoking; it's considered non-ethnical by society. The question remains: Could HM help in the case when only observational data is available (P(S, T, C))?
