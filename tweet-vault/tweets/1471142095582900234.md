@yudapearl @AndrewPGrieve @PavlosMsaouel @soboleffspaces @f2harrell @smueller @ChristosArgyrop The fact that the RCT does not use typical material is not an imperfection. Tight local control is more important than representativeness. The problem is not with the RCT. It's an imperfection of an observational study that such control is missing.
