@m_clem @PHuenermund @nickchk @yudapearl So as long as among those who completed 5th grade (Z=1), whether they complete 6th grade is "random" with respect to their potential score Y (no common cause that makes them drop 6th grade and also have lower scores), from the identification point of view that's ok. Same for Z =0
