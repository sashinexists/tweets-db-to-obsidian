Harvard Stat is where I first (1993) presented a seminar on backdoor, invited by Don Rubin -- spies tell me they are still using crystal balls for identification. Jokes aside, I know things have changed in adjacent departments, and I'll be happy to visit and remove more barriers. https://t.co/BikCd3p1uI
