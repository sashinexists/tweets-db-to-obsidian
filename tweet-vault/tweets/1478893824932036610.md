@GaryMarcus @ylecun @_WEEXIAO @Vlad_S @drfeifei @yudapearl @neurobongo @TimKietzmann @demishassabis @sama @ilyasut @koraykv @AndrewYNg @swarat This is a cool paper and I donâ€™t doubt that we have innate algebra but these are simple vs lambda calc.Also the content of each symbol is the harder problem and we are still stuck at getting that right from raw sensors. Top-down algebra knowledge cannot really solve that problem
