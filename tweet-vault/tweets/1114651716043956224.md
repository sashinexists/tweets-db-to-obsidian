@Jabaluck @autoregress @eliasbareinboim @juli_schuess @CarterPaddy @EpiEllie The thread I tried to recover was much longer, just two days ago. But we are not going anywhere on this track. I wish you could say: I, Jason, can answer these questions correctly w/o DAG. Instead, we hear about @autoregress doing it, or "Go read about credit expansion". I'm out.
