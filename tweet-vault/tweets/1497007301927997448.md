@PavlosMsaouel @AndersHuitfeldt @AndrewPGrieve @suiss70 @miquelporta The do-operator is more than just a "tool". The do-expression distinguishes Level 2 from Level 3 of the reasoning hierarchy, namely between questions that can be answered by RCT and those that can't. Same with a "causal model" (not DAG) - nothing can be inferred without it.
