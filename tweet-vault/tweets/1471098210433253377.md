@yudapearl @AndrewPGrieve @PavlosMsaouel @soboleffspaces @f2harrell @smueller @ChristosArgyrop 3/3) Para 4 then refers to "the" observational study but it has not been referred to before. Do you mean 'an' observational study? I also think that this para could do with more clarification, A simple table might help.
