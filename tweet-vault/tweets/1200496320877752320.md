@yudapearl @EpiEllie @ConiByera @LucyStats @AlexaYakubovich @AnjaLeist @rohitpojha @AbbyCScience @_MiguelHernan @casualinfer Point taken that a null effect is an effect, but I wouldn't call it or a constant function "pathological" any more than 0 is a "pathological" number for addition or 1 is "pathological" for multiplication. They are all just  identity elements in function spaces.
