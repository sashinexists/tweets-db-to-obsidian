@stephensenn @hmatejx @RWJE_BA I can guess what the difference is between "randomisation" and "random sampling" but, since it is not defined in terms of Nature (eg counterfactuals) I can't be sure, and hate to be told again "this is NOT what trialists are doing". The burden of description is with trialists.
