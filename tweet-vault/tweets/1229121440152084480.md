@Prof_Livengood @deborahlipstadt @IzaTabaro I am not inventing those terms, I am just quoting my Zionophobic colleagues: "Yes, every Israeli who does not support the dismantling of Israel and turning it into a Palestinian-majority state is complicit with the crime of the century." I read what they write.
