@yudapearl @DKedmey @EinatWilf If you’re using Zionophobe as an insult you’re grossly misunderstanding the state of things. I’m a proud anti-Zionist, and it’s genuinely a compliment to be recognized as one.
Zionism is not Judaism, as confirmed by an increasing number of anti-Zionist Jews. Be like them.
