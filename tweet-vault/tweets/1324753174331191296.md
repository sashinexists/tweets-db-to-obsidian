@Corey_Yanofsky @yudapearl Agreed. Neural nets and other function approximators encode priors on the function, the noise models etc. There is no reason to think that the model fit for x-&gt; y will be the same as the model fit for y-&gt; x. (Defining fit is tricky with diff output) This can suggest causal dir.
