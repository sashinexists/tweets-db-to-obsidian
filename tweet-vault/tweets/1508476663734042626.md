@RWJE_BA @yudapearl @soboleffspaces @noah_greifer @causalinf @EpiEllie @bveg3 What is a clear research question as apposed to a research question? I don’t know why you couldn’t use observational studies to help answer both those questions. Let’s not ignore the fact that finding the true answer is not possible. There’s always uncertainty. https://t.co/SyWPAaNk7Z
