@yudapearl I was a long-time supporter of AI. However, I do have concerns about its current head. She tweeted the lie that ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡± killed Yasser Arafat &amp; has never retracted it, while my reading of the AI report is that the existence of ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡± is an act of apartheid. I do wonder if sheâ€™s ğŸ‡µğŸ‡¸ agent?
