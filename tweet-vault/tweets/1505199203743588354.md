@HL327 @stephensenn @soboleffspaces @yudapearl @ADAlthousePhD @JFronczekMD @EpiEllie @f2harrell @statsepi @GuyattGH @GRADE_WG My understanding is that feedback arises when you have a cyclic process. Not all processes are cyclic, and ATE normally refers to a non-cyclic process, although it is possible to define it for a cyclic process too. Even when a process is cyclic, one can consider a single cycle.
