@anniefofani @yudapearl @AndrewPessin @EinatWilf I have to say that neither civic nor ethnic nationalism makes any sense to me. But regardless, if the US is indeed a civic national state, then that's a strike against it, no? I mean, the only thing Americans can agree upon today is that their politics is terrible.
