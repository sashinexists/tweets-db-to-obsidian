For a simple example consider a game where we win upon guessing the outcome of a fair coin and lose otherwise. The action "guess head" has no effect on winning, neither has "guess tail". Yet, upon winning, 
we can  assert: "Had we acted differently
we would have lost".#Bookofwhy https://t.co/i8Gc6WKb3V
