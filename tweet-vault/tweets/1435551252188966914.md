@yudapearl @tdietterich The philosopher @danieldennett comes to mind here. It’s extremely easy to dump on any area, to find the worst examples of people being idiots (perhaps the majority!) and write them off. But that’s not interesting, bc it’s a cudgel that can make any area look bad, incl causality.
