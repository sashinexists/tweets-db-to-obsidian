Controlling for a "broader set" makes sense when measurments have zero cost. But in most real life situations one cannot afford to control for EVERYHING that can possibly be measured and, then, cost-sufficiency-efficiency  considerations demand some domain models, namely DAGs. https://t.co/65w0a3smmJ
