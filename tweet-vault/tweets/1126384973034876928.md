@arih1987 @Stanford @mosaic @StanfordDaily The trick is not to dis-invite racist speakers but to politely explain to them why they should dis-invite themselves, as I tried to do with Cornell West https://t.co/VoGDiBDoQT
The host, the audience and the public got the idea, and some say the speaker got it too.
