@tdietterich @Grady_Booch @RichardSocher Maybe, but how then to make all that work in, say, making the kinds of inferences that Sherlock Holmes made or in devising a machine that could induce a double helix from the data Watson and Crick had available. @yudapearl is right that causality is a key part of the mix.
