@HannesMalmberg1 @Jabaluck @maximananyev You are beginning to see why I called it "undersold". But the gains are not merely educational, they are methodological and computational. Tasks that are intractable in PO (consistency, redundancy, testability, etc) suddenly become as easy as writing down an SEM. Sadly undersold.
