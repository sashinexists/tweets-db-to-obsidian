@sidinusofaiii @intensivemargin @CarterPaddy @mkessler_DC @t0nyyates @metrics52 ALPHA is any  parameter in your economic model. Most economists have trouble swallowing  that  elementary questions in Econ 101 (eg. about ALPHA) require tools developed elsewhere; they see it as an insult to the profession, so they hope @metrics52 has it. Does he? Please check.
