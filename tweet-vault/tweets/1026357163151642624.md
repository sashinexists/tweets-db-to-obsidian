@statwonk @fjsosah Being "focused" on causality does not mean being able to formalize it, or to answer causal questions formally. I claim that even Fisher could not prove that his RCT yields the desired causal effect, because he did not have notation for the latter. #Bookofwhy Same in ASA interview
