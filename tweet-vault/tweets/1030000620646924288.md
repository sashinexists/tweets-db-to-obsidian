@statsmethods @MaartenvSmeden @PWGTennant @yudapearl The % even mentioning the possibility of missing data is small/tiny. Most studies ignore this. So a bland blanket statement saying nothing more than they will use MI is better than nothing (IMHO). I have more problems with studies that make no mention of missing data (red flag!).
