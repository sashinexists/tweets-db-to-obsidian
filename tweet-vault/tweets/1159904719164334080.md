@ks445599 @dchackethal @SamHarrisOrg @yudapearl But why is that a requirement for induction?

What about going from observations to predictors for those observations is impossible?

Statistical predictors have their limitations. But model based predictors are much less limited, and those we gain confidence in by interventions.
