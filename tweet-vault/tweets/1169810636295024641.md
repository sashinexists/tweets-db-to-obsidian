@PHuenermund @yudapearl @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal I agree with you that empirical studies often cite earlier studies as potentially vindicating their identifying assumptions, and that DAGs are one way of organizing this kind of information. But I think those kinds of references are often unpersuasive RE: identifying assumptions.
