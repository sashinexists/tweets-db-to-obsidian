@alexdamour @eliasbareinboim @CsabaSzepesvari @mendel_random Reviewers suggest confounders if (1) the paper is about a specific domain and
(2) they know how to translate "ignorability" to DAG condition. But if the
paper is methodological, starting with "assume ignorability" means one thing: "I want to deal with statistical estimation only"
