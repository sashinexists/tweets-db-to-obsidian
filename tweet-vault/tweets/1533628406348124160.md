June 6th marks 74 years to the 6 day war. Some readers ask: "how did it start?" Many more ask: How come the West Bank is still under Israeli Rule? @EinatWilf has a simple answer, with which I fully agree, it's a necessary temporary control till the Arabs say: "Equally permanent" https://t.co/6sQ5dDtVCL
