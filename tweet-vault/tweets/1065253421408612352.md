@gchierico @MeaningLifeTV @robertwrighter @EddyNahmias I also got lost in this conversation. Compatibilists should focus their arguments on one question: How would I program a robot to have a sensation of free-will and harness this sensation to exhibit moral behavior. Once the conversation quits the robot, it gets lost in metaphysics
