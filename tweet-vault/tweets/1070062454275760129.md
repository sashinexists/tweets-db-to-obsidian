@eddericu @zshahn @yudapearl @_MiguelHernan I think I see what you mean, but even an experiment requires estimating e(Y(x=1)|x=0) for some people. On the other hand, if you mean cross-world counterfactuals like those required for mediation then yes we likely canâ€™t estimate those in an experiment.
