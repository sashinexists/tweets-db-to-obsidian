@ewerlopes @Muenchner_Junge Thanks for posting this course. I have seen many advertised under the catchy title "causal inference" which are doing ONLY estimation, leaving the assumptions to divine intervention. This course has Primer in its reading list - a faithful sign of enlightenment. #Bookofwhy
