@TIMO_32paths @yudapearl My guess is that it‚Äôs the outcome of the ‚Äúdiplomatic intifada.‚Äù There‚Äôs a long history of PLO using its NGOs as part of its statecraft, and üáµüá∏ has invested hugely in its spies. Everyone forgets that spies‚Äô jobs include influencing other states, as well as collecting intelligence.
