@TIMO_32paths @yudapearl My guess is that it’s the outcome of the “diplomatic intifada.” There’s a long history of PLO using its NGOs as part of its statecraft, and 🇵🇸 has invested hugely in its spies. Everyone forgets that spies’ jobs include influencing other states, as well as collecting intelligence.
