@Jabaluck @analisereal @eliasbareinboim @autoregress @yudapearl @PACESconsulting @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @HeerJeet I think it is important to note that economists do use the front-door logic in many papers (even Masters Joshway and Stevefu recommend it for some contexts), they just do not call it "front-door", and its assumptions are not always explored in any formal way.
