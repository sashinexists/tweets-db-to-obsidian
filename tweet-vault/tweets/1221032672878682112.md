@BenjaminMenashe @nntaleb @HarryDCrane I believe @nntaleb had in mind causal inference in probabilistic setting which, of course, #Bookofwhy and each of my writings is advertising in big megaphones. Not to be confused with "probabilistic causality" as an outdated branch of philosophy. See https://t.co/awr66UiqMV
