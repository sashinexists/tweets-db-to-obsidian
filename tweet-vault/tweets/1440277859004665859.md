@RaniaKassi @yudapearl @EinatWilf @newzionists Herzl, and Zionism itself, are a product of the 19th century Europe. It’s not at all surprising the original context was colonial. That said, the constitution of the US was conceived by slave holders, who probably had very different notions from ours of what ‘Freedom’ is.
