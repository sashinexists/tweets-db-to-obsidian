@yudapearl @cdsamii @analisereal I would have said the opposite -- the model forces me to torment myself by specifying how X2 relates to the observables and unobservables rather than sweeping it under the rug ;). More seriously, I don't see any reason other than time costs not to at least compute bounds...
