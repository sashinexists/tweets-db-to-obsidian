@omaclaren @eliasbareinboim @stephensenn I wish someone would plot the frequency of the words "cause" or "causal" vs.
time, from 1900 to 2019 and tell us, straight face, "No! There was no causal revolution in 1990s". (There were 13 such papers in JSM 2003) Why are u resisting the idea of a paradigm shift? #Bookofwhy
