@analisereal @seanjtaylor @pablogerbas @alexpghayes @yudapearl Honestly, It boggles me the fact that this discussion turned into SM or not to SM. I guess it can be attributed to Tweeter caos (who thought thread of threads was a good idea)? But the fact that it did doesn't strike me as great PR for the SM approach.
