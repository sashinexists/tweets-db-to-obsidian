@yudapearl @_MiguelHernan @EpiEllie (2/2) If the causal question "take this pill w left hand" has a different answer from "take this pill wright hand", then a graph with only "take this pill" is not well-defined. The fact that you can get an answer within the model is a fact about the map, not the territory
