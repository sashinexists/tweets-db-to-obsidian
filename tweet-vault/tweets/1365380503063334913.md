I conjecture that the "logic of hunches" will invoke metaphorical analogies to our toy world. E.g., "an electron acts like a tiny baseball, so it must have spin. Gee, how would I measure it if it does?". In other words, direct experience with baseballs act as a causal model. https://t.co/AzSCxZHgVp
