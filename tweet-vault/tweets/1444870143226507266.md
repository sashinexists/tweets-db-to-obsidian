@HannesMalmberg1 @pablogerbas @instrumenthull @lewbel So, can I conclude that what makes "design-based" different from "model-based" is the reliance on some variable(s) Z known to be physically randomized. We have been doing it, routinely, in what we labeled "Data  Fusion"
Have we been crossing into "design" territory?
I hope not.
