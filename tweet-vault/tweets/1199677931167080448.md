@yudapearl @rohitpojha @EpiEllie @AbbyCScience @Lester_Domes @_MiguelHernan @casualinfer The term 'target trial' is very helpful as tag for studies with observational data where authors have set up the data in a way they would analyze a trial. As a reader I will see the term target trial and know that people have at least thought abt asking the right causal question.
