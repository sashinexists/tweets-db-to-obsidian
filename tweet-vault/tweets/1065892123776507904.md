@yudapearl @eliasbareinboim @jasonhartford @zacharylipton @CsabaSzepesvari @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @ShalitUri I agree with this, and think that's largely what makes causality for RL interesting. However, I'd love to see examples where leveraging counterfactual knowledge for RL has lead to strong empirical success.
