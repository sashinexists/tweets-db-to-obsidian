@emc2G @yudapearl @Ilhan @RashidaTlaib @PeterBeinart After much dissembling, Miftah apologized 4 promoting a medieval blood libel. It never apologized 4 promoting articles by White Supremacists about “Jewish control” of the media &amp; USA. &amp; it never apologized 4 lauding people who murder Jewish kids. Sorry, this isn’t “complicated. “
