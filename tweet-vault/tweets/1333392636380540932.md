My wife had a similar experience, when forced to leave Iraq with one suitcase (1951). Yet she would not beg the UN to restore her rights to property &amp; return. Instead, she appeals to the Iraqi Govt to recognize Israel, allowing her family to live in peace &amp; dignity, as equals. https://t.co/84cGZW8duw
