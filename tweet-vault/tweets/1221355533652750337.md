@talyarkoni @dileeplearning @adamlewisgreen @GaryMarcus @BethCarey12 Should we really cast them as "open empirical questions" when we have mathematical results on what is doable and undoable irrespective of NN architectures ?? Not sure. Empirical claims are subject to interpretation when we get to higher level AI tasks #Bookofwhy
