@stephensenn @yudapearl @AndrewPGrieve @PavlosMsaouel @f2harrell @smueller @ChristosArgyrop Basically, he stratifies on some variables to reduce variation between two units in a block (=stratum), right? 
@yudapearl goes further. He proposes to block (=stratify) by variables that block (=stop) the effect of other variables on treatment choice and outcome occurrence.
