@IvanWerning @Jabaluck @steventberry @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @MariaGlymour @autoregress Totally agree that "reduced form" is a source of much confusion. It gives the impression that it is merely a syntactic transformation of "form" with no loss of information. But if it is "descriptive", then we loose all the causal information that SEM provides. Shun! #Bookofwhy
