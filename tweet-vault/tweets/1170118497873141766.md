@Jabaluck @yudapearl @PHuenermund @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal Ok I want to evaluate whether there are racial disparities in mortality among cancer patients. Question: do minorities have higher rates of mortality as compared to whites. I am curious to see how you tackle this problem.
