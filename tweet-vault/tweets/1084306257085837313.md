@eliasbareinboim @statwonk @yudapearl @PHuenermund The funny thing is that you say BHM is about estimation, but I’m saying it’s about model construction. Then you ask me about estimation, but again I’m saying it’s about model construction. The interesting thing seems to be: what happens if I don’t know the full model?
