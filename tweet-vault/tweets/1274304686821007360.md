1/4 Comments on your Front-Door paper:
* The expression "a single, strictly exogenous mediator
variable" is problematic: (1)  Causality p. 82 defines
FDC as "A set of variables", not "a single variable". (2)  
"exogenous mediator" is an oxymoron. I originally
called it (1973): https://t.co/CWRPT8EuF8
