cause. We would expect that P(E | C) would be greater than P(E | B) or P(E | A). If we can’t get those, then we might also expect that P(E | A &amp; B) would be less than P(E | A &amp; B &amp; C), but P(E | A &amp; C) ~= P(E | B &amp; C) ~= P(E | A &amp; B &amp; C). Can’t we just play these conditioning
