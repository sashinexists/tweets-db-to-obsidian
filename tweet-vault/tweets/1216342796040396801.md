@raj_mehta @venkmurthy @cecilejanssens @mendel_random @resourcefulco @drjohnm Of course, the “closed system” of physics is a fiction, too. Working out an idea in formal terms often helps for revealing its structure and connections. Does ‘ergodicity’ in medical sciences have deep, substantive connections with stat mech, or is it just a superficial metaphor?
