@CausalHuber @artistexyz @causalinf @unifr Correct me if I am wrong, but I think only economists use the term "identifying assumptions," tacitly implying that certain assumptions are made in order to identify things, not because they are actually believed. Do you think PO assumptions can ever be judged for believability?
