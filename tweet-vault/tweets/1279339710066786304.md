@EricTopol @CarnegieCorp @DrSidMukherjee @AnnaPodolanczuk Strange, when people label me an "immigrant", I feel mighty privileged, not as a member of an under-privileged under-represented minority. This is perhaps unique to US and Israel; two countries were differences are virtue. Happy 4th of July.
