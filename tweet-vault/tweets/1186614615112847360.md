So deeply sad we can't be there at Stanford, but Charlie &amp; I will sing with u at 10pm in NY, &amp; Jasper at 9pm in Iowa. May your voice ring loudly reverberating across this country,planet &amp;galaxy filling the universe with the vital harmony of sanity and peace.#DanielPearlMusicDays https://t.co/x1CR4iuzMM
