@eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @PHuenermund @dhillon_p @deaneckles I am sorry, but from your comments, I see that you are not still not getting what the paper is about. If you think otherwise, then please refer to a specific deficiency in what is presented there. It is a preliminary draft, but nonetheless I would welcome it as we update it.
