@mishtal @Ixar_Bargains A Palestinian colleague once argued that Palestine was there first, because Philistines are mentioned in Egyptian records, not Israel. He dropped this argument once I proved to him that his connection to Philistines is weaker than my grand-mother connection to the grand-canyon.
