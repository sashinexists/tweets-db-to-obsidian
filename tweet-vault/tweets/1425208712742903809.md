@deaneckles @ben_golub @lewbel Strictly speaking "nonparametrics" stands for "No restrictions on the functions or on the error distributions". See Causality. But the motivation is not fear of parameters per se, but fear of the indefensible. If you have a parametric assumption that is defensible, by all means.
