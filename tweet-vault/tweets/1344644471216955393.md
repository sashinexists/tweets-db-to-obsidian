Another thought on an this article. Everyone understands that "forecast" is far from "understanding" (See Toulmin's 1961) and the difference has been a point of fierce contention in AI. Yet I am not aware of a formal criterion for this demarcation - strange for computer science. https://t.co/lVJh2a3aQz
