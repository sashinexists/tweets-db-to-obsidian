@econshishir @_MiguelHernan I havn't taken this course, but from what I recall, the Harvard group lumps together Rung-1 and Rung-2 of the Ladder of Causation. This would confound quantities computable from interventional studies with those that require  counterfactual information -- causing confusion.
