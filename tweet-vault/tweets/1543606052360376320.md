@anon61845948 @jrootham @MelissaLantsman Beg to differ. An ethnic group that equates its liberation, loudly and unequivably, with the elimination of another ethnic group is not equally deserving of support and respect. Please listen to how THEY define  liberation, not how Westerners wish them to define it.
