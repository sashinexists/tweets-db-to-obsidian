The #Bookofwhy goes through several such oversights. The most common one is enshrined in the word "malaria" (Mal Air) The less known is the death of Captain Scott at the South Pole, attributed to scurvy which, despite James Lind's observations was misunderstood till the 1930's. https://t.co/7ID2myzWnR
