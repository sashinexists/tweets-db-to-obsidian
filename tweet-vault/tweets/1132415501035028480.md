@yudapearl @Vieroe @jvplive Zionism is an ideology, and as you have clearly articulated, is associated with Israeli settler colonization and the active denial of human rights to indegenous peoples. This is why UN resolution 3379 voted Zionism to be a form of racism. Anti-Zionism is therefore anti-racism.
