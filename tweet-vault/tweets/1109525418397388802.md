@analisereal @convexify @paulnovosad @btshapir @yudapearl @eliasbareinboim Where I think DAGs go beyond what economists would intuit without them is the generalization of the front-door criterion beyond one-sided non-compliance. Here, I think economists have not traditionally applied the "front-door criterion".
