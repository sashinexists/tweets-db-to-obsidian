@PhilHaile @sbuhai @yudapearl @JaapAbbring @Chris_Auld @DonskerClass @lewbel @steventberry I would call a LATE estimand a casual one (the way Guido calls it) , it is also ratio of two reduced form estimand. In the context of demand analysis, I would call LATE an estimate of a structural parameter (weighted demand elasticity).  That is my own view; I am not imposing.ðŸ˜€
