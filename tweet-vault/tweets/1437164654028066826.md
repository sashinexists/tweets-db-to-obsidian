1/3 Thanks, Judea! Yes, we should have added a summary. To start, the do calc is already 'efficient' (to be more precise, it can be algorithmized), for non-param (NP) identification, transportability, selection bias. Ie, it's perfect in these settings. (Skipping the estimation.) https://t.co/vkz5HKwUyC
