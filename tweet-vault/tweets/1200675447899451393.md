To clarify, what is a "Causal Notion"? It's a notion that cannot be defined in terms of distributions over observed variables, so Y(x) is certainly "causal". Harvard's folks would object: "If you find E[Y(x)]=5, it doesn't tell you if X causes Y." True RCT thinking. #Bookofwhy https://t.co/nSGDlrIz7y
