@the_dismal_tide @kareem_carr I would join one of the dozens Data Science Centers now erected across the country and keep on bugging my mentors: "Hey, and where is the Science in our building?" .
Simultaneously I would take one of the obstacles of ML, say transfer learning and overcome it  using "science".
