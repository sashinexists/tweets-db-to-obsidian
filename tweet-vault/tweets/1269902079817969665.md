Agree. To be a "science", "data-science" should read "data-assisted-science". The way it reads now, "the science of data" has little to do with science, it has turned into "computer-assisted-statistics" or "statistics on stereoides". Yet donors love building those tall "Centers." https://t.co/cS41W4ut5K
