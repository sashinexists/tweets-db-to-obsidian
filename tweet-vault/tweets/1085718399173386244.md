@IntuitMachine @tdietterich @GaryMarcus @Grady_Booch @RichardSocher @demishassabis From my humble lens, Deep RL is semi-interventional, for it cannot infer consequences of untried actions (eg ban cigarettes, raise minimum wage). I would also hesitate making a big fuss about abduction; it has become a technical term, meaning different things to different folks.
