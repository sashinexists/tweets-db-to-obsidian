Just finished intro of #bookofwhy by @yudapearl. This is gonna be fun, and undoubtedly a great addition to scientific community. But, i'm puzzled by statements like this one. Isn't this what scientists as J.Robins and D.Rubin from @Harvard and many others were doing for decades. https://t.co/tGwCAD8QD9
