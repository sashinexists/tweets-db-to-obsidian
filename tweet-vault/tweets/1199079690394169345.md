@osazuwa @ang_hermann @furtadobb @paul_conyngham @analisereal Conditional Policies and Stochastic Policies are discussed in Chapter 4 of Causality. It shows that if we know P(y|do(x), z) then we can compute the effect of a policy X=g(z) i.e., Act X in response to observation Z=z. See also Dynamic Process Control p. 74. #Bookofwhy
