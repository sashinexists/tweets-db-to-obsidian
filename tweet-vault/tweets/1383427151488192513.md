@biosbenk @ildiazm @f2harrell @Lester_Domes @PavlosMsaouel @drjgauthier @yudapearl @kdpsinghlab @AleksiReito @tslumley I see. yeah I’m also curious what in particular Frank has in mind - maybe just explicitly allowing the log HR to vary over time, h(t;Z) = h0(t)exp(b(t)*Z)?

Could use a Gamma Process prior on h0. Could do Bart or GP for b(t) and shrink towards constant effect b(t)=b
