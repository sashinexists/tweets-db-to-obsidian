@dileeplearning @tdietterich @alok_damle @yudapearl @MarcioMinicz Many expect detecting AGI by its profound insights and discoveries. General intelligence doesn’t imply strong correctness; it can be deeply flawed too: full humanity has lived many years under aberrant rules for today’s standards (mysticism, sacrifice, slavery…) Is it even over?
