@yudapearl @f2harrell @EpiEllie @_MiguelHernan The use of pre- and post- language seems to embed the model temporally, no? I assume the do-operator still works in the non-temporal case such as outcome distributions under treatment vs placebo, i.e., the classic two arm trial. Any change to language there?
