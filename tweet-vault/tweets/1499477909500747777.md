@statsepi @yudapearl @ADAlthousePhD @stephensenn @f2harrell @soboleffspaces @SMuellerLab I suspect that leading RCT experts can live without a formal causal framework. However, I agree it may help understand &amp; avoid certain problems for less able trialists. This is my argument in observational data too. Causal diagrams democratise understanding of various phenomenon.
