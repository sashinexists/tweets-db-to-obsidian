@YouTube has taken down an interview I gave yesterday explaining why Israel's airstrikes in Gaza are legal under int'l law. It was a calm, academic presentation - but made the case well, I thought. Removed for "violating Community Guidelines." Pls retweet &amp; write to @Youtube https://t.co/YeFnuTEchX
