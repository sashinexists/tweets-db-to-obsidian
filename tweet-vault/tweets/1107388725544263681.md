@eliasbareinboim @autoregress @yudapearl @CarterPaddy Those of us who have read your papers can solve it. But you're missing the point entirely. You keep claiming that empirical research is doing "the problem compounded w/ 10 others." I don't think that's how empirical research works (and I've done lots of it!)
