@RWJE_BA @soboleffspaces @yudapearl @noah_greifer @causalinf @EpiEllie @bveg3 So you realize you’d have assumptions for the treatment effect for an RCT as well right?
Your last sentence tells me you think RCT’s have automatic precision and accuracy. If RCT’s always gave you the estimand, why ever do another?
