@stephensenn @yudapearl @f2harrell @AndrewPGrieve @PavlosMsaouel @soboleffspaces @ChristosArgyrop @smueller I only assumed a constant risk difference &amp; the ‘facts’ from the blog. I haven’t considered other implications. I could have assumed a constant OR or RR etc &amp; constructed a similar rationale. My impression was that the blog was based on the (hidden) scenario that I described.
