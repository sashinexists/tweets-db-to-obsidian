The corresponding DAG for Wald's airplane was a collider
             # of holes ----&gt;survival&lt;----location
The army observed more holes (per sq. inch) in the fuselage than the engine, &amp; recommended more armor on the former. This dependence however was created by selection bias. https://t.co/GJY5b6uNBb
