@Prof_Livengood @deborahlipstadt @IzaTabaro I am talking "material support", funding and political, not merely sentimental. I believe those who assist a criminal escape, or avoid justice are considered complicit to the crime. Moreover, anti-Zionists consider Israel's very existence, not its Government, to be the criminal.
