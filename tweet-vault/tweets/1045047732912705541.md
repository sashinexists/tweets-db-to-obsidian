@eliasbareinboim @deaneckles @yudapearl These examples seem to move back to a position where we *should* accept the idea of an "effect of gender" if we want gender to feature in the graph, no? Remember, the question was whether we could avoid such a commitment &amp; still use gender for identification (a la @deaneckles).
