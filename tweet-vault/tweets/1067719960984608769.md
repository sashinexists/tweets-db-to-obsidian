@fhuszar @eliasbareinboim @CsabaSzepesvari Counterfactuals are never terribly difficult to describe. If they were then causal inference would be difficult, but it is easy. I remember the Botou paper and classified it as an instance of process control problems (Causality pp. 74-76). Again, not hard to describe or solve .
