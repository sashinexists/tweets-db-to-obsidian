An Israeli friend wrote me how he got a phone call that someone did not show up for their vaccination appointment, if he wants to get one. In half an hour he and his wife were vaccinated, no wait, no uncertainty; polite, effective and done. Amazing - over a million people!!! https://t.co/APJnCgV4wS
