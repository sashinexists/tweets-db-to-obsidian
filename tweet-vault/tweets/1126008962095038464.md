@JDHaltigan @juli_schuess @doinkboy I love this argument, but I dont think manipulationists like Hernan will buy it. They would say: OK,"U causes Y" colloquially, but thou shall never say "causal effect of U." Sounds a bit inconsistent? Agree. But we have not heard from them since https://t.co/wpzH95BvNP #Bookofwhy
