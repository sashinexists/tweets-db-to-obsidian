@yudapearl @smueller Dear Prof. Pearl, I think itâ€™s unlikely for conclusions from an RCT to be reversed by an obs. study (e.g. consistent benefit in males &amp; females in a trial overruled by harm for males in an obs. study). RCTs can demonstrate differential treatment effects + deal with confounding.
