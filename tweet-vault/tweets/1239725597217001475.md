@DKedmey @HarryDCrane One important caveat. If you know nothing about your past behavior except that you are like anyone else in a given subpopulation S, then the personal question: "Would I recover if I take this drug" can be answered from population-level data: find P(recover|do(drug),S). #Bookofwhy
