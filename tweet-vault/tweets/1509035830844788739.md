@soboleffspaces @yudapearl @nickchk @Lizstuartdc @PWGTennant DAGs cannot prove causality. They can help infer consequences of interventions or counterfactual scenarios based on causal knowledge/assumptions modeled in the DAGs, if the edges are oriented causally. To start with, intervention (e.g. RCT) is used to figure out these “arrows”.
