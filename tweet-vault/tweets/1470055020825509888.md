@guyharvey70 @soboleffspaces @stephensenn @AndrewPGrieve @PavlosMsaouel @f2harrell Let's pursue your request! I see  that you are asking for a measure that an individual patient can understand, to help make a personal decision. Statistics cannot provide it from  population data. Please take a look at https://t.co/lzxR8AR9QQ ; isn't it what you need?
