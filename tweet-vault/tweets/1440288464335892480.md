@gilled34 @yudapearl @EinatWilf @newzionists Can a people who claim to be modern &amp; enlightened ignore the realities of how their state was formed &amp; sustained?

This is why Israel is sliding into fascism. Its the only way to get people to accept it. Dehumanising the other ("death to all arabs") to justify Jewish supremacism
