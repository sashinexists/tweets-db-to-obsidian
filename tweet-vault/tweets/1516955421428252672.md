@ADLMidwest @SAFECUNY @UofIllinois I am more distressed by the timidity of Hillel's students (and director), speaking as though Israel's actions are indefensible, and as though Israel survival is not central to Jewish life. This is not the Hillel I knew, it's a Hillel that projects guilt and invites more bullying
