@RWJE_BA @yudapearl @stephensenn I don't follow. I'm an exp. HEP physicist and we described everything through the data generating process (and then either predicted or fitted the unknowns). However, I don't see the clash that you are describing. SCMs are exactly that, postulated data gen. process.
