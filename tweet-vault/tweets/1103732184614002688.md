@eliasbareinboim @yudapearl So you appear to be hung up on me taking for granted that θ live in a space Θ. Of course they do. Lower case theta is a model M for which we can compute queries g(θ), upper case is the class they live in. No different to 3.2.3 as far as I can tell https://t.co/PM2x9aBNxu
