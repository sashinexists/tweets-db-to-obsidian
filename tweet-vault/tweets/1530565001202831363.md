@yudapearl @philipcball @newscientist @renzocom You're referring to the measures, PS, PN, and PNS (as described below in your paper)? If so, they seem to involve probabilities. Or are you referring to our definitions like probability of sufficiency (i.e., the simpler  p(effect|cause)? Or are you curious as to the relation? https://t.co/6rHRhCEOXG
