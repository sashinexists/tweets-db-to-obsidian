@ItsAStatLife @eliasbareinboim @yudapearl Robin, there is a note claiming it is not obvious how causal diagrams help solving a problem when in fact it is trivial.  What do you do? You just let the misconception propagate, or take the time to show it is in fact trivial, and the extra derivation was simply unnecessary?
