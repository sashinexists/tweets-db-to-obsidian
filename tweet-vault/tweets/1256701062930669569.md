@AsraNomani @UmarCheema1 @yudapearl An american, Raymond Davis had killed our 4young men in front of many witnesses on a main road . He was not even indicted, bcz of being american . He is now roaming about freely there. Have Americans ever asked their courts for justice for the families of those poor souls?
