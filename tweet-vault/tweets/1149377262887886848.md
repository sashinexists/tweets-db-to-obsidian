@elizpingree @BridgetPhetasy @yudapearl It's good.

My only criticism with the good is that it lies some strange place just between popular science and a proper technical book. I'd rather read something that is more in either direction.

So I think I'm gonna read his primer that is more technical and mathematical. https://t.co/1ibRrIcb13
