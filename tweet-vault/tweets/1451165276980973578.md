@EnLiEretzAheret @laltp @jenmittelman @RepGraceMeng But observe how careful these racists are to signal how they love Jews, and hate only Zionists. If we, Jews, do not make sure that this kind of hate in itself is as socially unaccepted as Islamophobia and homophobia, the will continue to play the word game of "We love Jews".
