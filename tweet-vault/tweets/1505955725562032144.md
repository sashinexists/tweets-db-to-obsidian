@soboleffspaces @yudapearl @RWJE_BA No question that we use the best available evidence (sometimes lower quality), RCTs are not always available/indicated. At the same time, we can use interactions in randomised trials that precede such observational studies. Why is it a disservice? How can I do better? Honest Qs.
