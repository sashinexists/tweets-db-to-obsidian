@yudapearl @havivrettiggur @DJMinded and 3. Israel is already doing its best and is not obligated to provide any more aid to Palestinians in their endeavour to come to terms with Israelâ€™s permanence, what can be done? Is the case hopeless? Or do you believe Palestinians can radically change without external help?
