@raj_mehta @stephensenn @smueller @miquelporta @f2harrell @suiss70 Nice paper for 1999. Note however that Altman defines NNT as "number of patients who need to be treated ...  for one additional patient to benefit" not realizing that "benefit" is counterfactual, so, all his calculations tacitly assume "no harm". See corrected Wikipedia,
