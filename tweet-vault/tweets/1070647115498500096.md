@stevesphd @mendel_random @jwbelmon Good Ans. But IV too relies on the assumption of ignorability, plus exclusion. Rubin's dictum? My rebuttal still stands. Supertransparent? What other causal models have you analyzed? Most importantly, we need analysis to handle 12 interacting IV's, with or without dictums.
