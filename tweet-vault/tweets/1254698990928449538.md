Update on Israel Memorial Day. The sirens will sound today (Monday) at 8:00 pm Israel time (1 pm EST,10 am PST). Join me in freezing (1 min) for Dani Balkore, who went to fight five invading armies in May of 1948, and made it possible for my generation to live a semi-normal life. https://t.co/5qlkLlfyma
