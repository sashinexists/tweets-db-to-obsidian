@RWJE_BA @noah_greifer @soboleffspaces @yudapearl @causalinf @EpiEllie @bveg3 I understand that in general there would be more assumptions for one, because one is more complex. But if more is important to you, Iâ€™d want to see what difference is number of assumptions is important. Because to me, just having more is not a strong argument.
