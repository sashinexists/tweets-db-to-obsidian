@analisereal @autoregress @causalinf Agree. Only he who has not tried it would say "it is a matter of taste". I urge all passengers to try it  before speaking "about it". Computer science students  learn that good "representation"  is more than just taste, its the difference between doable and undoable. #Bookofwhy
