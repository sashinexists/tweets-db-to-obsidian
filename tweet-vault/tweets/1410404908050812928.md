@yudapearl @guido_imbens @Susan_Athey @therajchetty In the presentation that Ibens gave at https://t.co/1ygnZgu5mP
he had 2 DAGs, but in this paper on the same subject, he has none. That is so ridiculous. Like DAGs are cheating and not worthy of being published. I think not publishing the DAGs is the real cheating.
