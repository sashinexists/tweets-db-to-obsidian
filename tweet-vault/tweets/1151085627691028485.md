@AndersHuitfeldt @yudapearl @djvanness An analogy - imagine if Newtonâ€™s 2nd law said the rate of change of momentum of a system is equal to some arbitrary function of all forces acting on that system, rather than to the sum of forces. What if I then remove one force from those acting on the system?
