@yudapearl @RonKenett 1/2 "all assumptions are stated, because it is a data-generating process" Really? Look at the 40 examples given in Fig 1&amp;3 https://t.co/xRKxsRY0wU . Each could correspond to 6.9a. Yet, the 20 of Fig 3 show a consistent message &amp; the 20 of Fig 1 don't. Can #Bokkofwhy tell Why?
