@kareem_carr @EpiEllie @yudapearl No, *basic* econometrics is designed to do this. The work on uncertainty in AI over the past 25 years is important, but it's largely unrelated to modern ML. 

When people talk about "advanced machine learning" they mean DNNs, GANs, etc. (which don't do causality,) not SCMs. https://t.co/TvNfFPxohe
