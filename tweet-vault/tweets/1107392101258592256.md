@Jabaluck @autoregress @yudapearl @CarterPaddy If my logic is not clear at this point, it's hard for me to continue. The logic is so straightforward - if anyone claims to solve systems of partial diff equations, solving additions shouldn't be a hurdle or need 30 tweets. If asking about 4-var IVs is deemed unfair, never mind..
