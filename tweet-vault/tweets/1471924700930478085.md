@stephensenn @yudapearl @AndrewPGrieve @PavlosMsaouel @f2harrell @smueller @ChristosArgyrop Selection itself could be effectively presented in DAG: there’s literature using this for matched study designs… ‘deliberate confounding’ is just by adding a node linked to X and Y directly… IBD? That would be an excellent question for a PhD study, for the smarts like @smueller
