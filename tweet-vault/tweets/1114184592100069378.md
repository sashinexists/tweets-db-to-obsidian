@DToshkov @cdsamii @EpiEllie @yudapearl @FHaege A structural causal model (SCM) is a collection of mechanisms, so, at this point, it sounds like you are referring to an SCM. But I am not sure. When you say "generate strange/complex behavior", are you referring to the observational or the interventional distributions?
