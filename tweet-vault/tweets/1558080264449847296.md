@DialSquareNZ @idatheleader @mishtal The number gap has always been against us, yet the world came to see our side in Nov. 1947, when we proudly touted our cause and exposed our enemies intentions. Today, we are moaning: Oy Vey! Antisemism! (which no one takes seriously) Instead of shouting:  Zionophobes! Get out!
