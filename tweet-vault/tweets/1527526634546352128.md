In DAGs, counterfactual nodes Y_x exist in the mutilated models, M_x, as Fig. 44  https://t.co/Sf5yw328zl.
To relate them to the original graph we construct a twin network, or ask: What exogeneous variables U* (in M_x) are responsible for variations in Y. Y_x has same stat as U*. https://t.co/6SDUBJsJhr
