@howardrgold1 @fcpsnews @Harvard @yudapearl Admissions is less and less about test scores because thatâ€™s a way to actualize anti-Asian racism. I have no idea why you are being an apologist for systemic racism against Asians. You know better. Again, the presence of Asians does not prove the absence of racism.
