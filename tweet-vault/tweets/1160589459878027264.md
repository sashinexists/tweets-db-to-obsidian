@yudapearl @MariaGlymour @Jabaluck @IvanWerning @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @autoregress I agree with your translation of reduced form. However, it came out of linear structural equations modeling, clear-headed folks who very clearly did not want to justify OLS. It was used to help explain 2 practical implementations of correct IV methods.
