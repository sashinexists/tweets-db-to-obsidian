@artistexyz @MatheusFacure @VC31415 @causalinf In general, "causing something is not a binary property", agree. This is not the case, however, for potential outcomes, {Y(0),Y(1)}, which are DEFINED  as "all variations in Y occurring while we holding D fixed." Such variations, the diagram shows, cannot be caused by D.
