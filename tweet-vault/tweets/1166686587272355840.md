@emc2G @DanzigMD @Ilhan @RashidaTlaib @PeterBeinart And you buy into this racist propaganda? Would you use the "separate but equal" metaphor on any other 2-states, say US &amp; Canada? or US &amp; Mexico? This comparison to racial segregation was manufactured by enemies of coexistence, and people in your sphere of information buy it?? SAD
