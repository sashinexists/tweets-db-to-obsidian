@fuzzydunlop123 @Jabaluck @alexpghayes @steventberry @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @yudapearl @MariaGlymour @autoregress I guess a key point about the diff equations is that they are *derived* from ‘causal’ assumptions like conservation of mass (for the enzyme case). There are very general semantics behind the derivation of equations that we spend a lot of time on and that seem different to DAGs
