@steventberry @PhilHaile @VC31415 My point is that, in order to decide whether a problem is more or less suited to DAGs we need to know what DAGs can do. Moreover, if its less suited to DAGs, we have SCM to work with, and the First Law, and more. My question is whether you know an econ problem that is beyond SCM.
