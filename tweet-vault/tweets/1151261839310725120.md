@djvanness @AndersHuitfeldt @yudapearl IMO DAGs make both too strong (eg why functions rather than differential equations etc?) &amp; too weak (eg how can we distinguish qualitatively different *mechanisms*?) assumptions for many applications. Useful in some cases, worth turning to ‘mathematical modelling’ lit for others
