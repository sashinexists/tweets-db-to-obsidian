@yudapearl @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @Jabaluck @HeerJeet Without this concern we might say -- aha! "selection on observables" tells us the effect of Z on Y given W. Combining this with the RCT total effect would give us the direct effect of X ... at least intuitively. We'd surely need a model (DAG or PO) to derive the exact calculation
