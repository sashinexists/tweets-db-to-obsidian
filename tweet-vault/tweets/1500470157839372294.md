@yudapearl @soboleffspaces @hemanth_kanak @ADAlthousePhD @PavlosMsaouel @GustafRydevik @stephensenn @f2harrell (3/3) In my opinion, motivating examples presented in this article (https://t.co/plaFQWBuxs) naively assume that decision makers treat evidence from observational studies and randomised trials the same. This is not the case.
