@AndersHuitfeldt @yudapearl Also, the interpretation problems in the example seems to some extent to be due to perhaps a bit carelessly adding together outcomes that might be affected oppositely by the intervention, and then dichotomising the sum to pass/not pass. The resulting information loss is massive.
