@SamuelJWeinberg @Ya3il8200 @blakeflayton One tiny logical misstep in you argument. If the disparities observed are the result of perpetual and persistent denial of normalcy by Israel's neighbors,  then "systemic inequity" and "oppression" are indeed but populist slogans -- these would disappear once denial is rescinded.
