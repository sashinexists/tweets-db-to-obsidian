@EpiEllie @OSUPublicHealth @yudapearl @JudithSchwart20 @zack_weber @angrightmeow The general consensus from early PhD students was that they werenâ€™t strongly familiar w/ stats presented. However, others like @JudithSchwart20 &amp; I thoroughly enjoyed it! Perhaps Ch7 audience does require having been previously exposed to some advanced epi&amp; stats methods. 3/6
