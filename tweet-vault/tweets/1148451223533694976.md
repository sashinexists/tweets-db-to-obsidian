@yudapearl @autoregress @MariaGlymour @PHuenermund @EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer @metrics52 And to answer your question, I'd guess most of Angrist's students would get your toy questions right, but I agree they are easier with DAGs. Now, can we dispense with your made up problems and look at actual research papers and see if DAGs can help?
