@Jabaluck @yudapearl @MariaGlymour @PHuenermund @EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer To be fair to epi, Jason, some questions may be important enough to try to answer without a clean q-e, and econ is certainly not without back-door path papers (in fact I think that's what first started this thread, years ago).
