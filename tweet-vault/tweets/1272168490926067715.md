@yudapearl @jodiecongirl 1. Statisticians donâ€™t know the difference between prediction and retrodiction. Thatâ€™s why we need causal inference. ðŸ™‚ 2. Parents income could be either one depending on the context. Strictly speaking, typically you learn after you build your model so itâ€™s a prediction.
