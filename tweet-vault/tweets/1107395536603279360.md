@eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @Jabaluck @CarterPaddy What makes a solution "natural"? Prob base 10 is more natural than 8 -- are PO and DAGs not similarly equivalent? 

Since you asked, here's my PO take on frontdoor. Seems pretty straightforward? Again, I'm not saying frontdoor isn't neat; just not convinced its very useful (yet) https://t.co/pnvcmxWKUN
