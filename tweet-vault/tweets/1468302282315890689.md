@DJMinded @ADL @ajc @HillelIntl Everyone is against "imposing apartheid" - that's easy. But occasionally I tend to forgive what appears to be "apartheid", for example, how they separate American from non-American passengers in airport terminals, or vaccinated from non-vaccinated customers in theatres. Awful!
