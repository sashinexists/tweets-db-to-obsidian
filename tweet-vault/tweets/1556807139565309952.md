@EpiEllie @pietrobiroli @PHuenermund @instrumenthull @paulgp @dlmillimet @eliasbareinboim See Equation (9) in https://t.co/gvwnPKDGKH 
Reading: NDE measures the expected increase in Y as the treatment changes from T = 0 to T = 1, while setting the mediator variable to whatever value it would have attained (for each individual) prior to the change, that is, under T= 0.
