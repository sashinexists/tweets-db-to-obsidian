@yudapearl @paul_snively @DavidDeutschOxf do ops are certainly defined in probability theory. I believe one J. Pearl first defined them in probability by his beautiful prescription,do(X)=x means amputate the arrows entering X,and set X to x. This results in a Bayesian Network with new PROBABILITIES attached to each node.
