There is a tiny difference. Nazi Germany did not say: "Some Jews are good Jews". The new haters are more sneaky, hence much more dangerous. They say or imply: "Nor all Jews are sub-humans, only Israel supporters." Even @AOC has learned the mantra: "My Jewish brothers and sisters" https://t.co/AKcpqeke1i
