@geomblog @instrumenthull @MeganTStevenson @PHuenermund @paulgp @dlmillimet @pietrobiroli @eliasbareinboim @josh_t_dean Interesting paper, ending with an unresolved dilemma: Can "constitutive relationships," those defining what discrimination IS, be represented by, or derive from DAGs and/or counterfactuals?
I believe they can, and the paper does not (yet) convince me that they can't.
