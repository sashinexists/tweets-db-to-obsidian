@omaclaren @Lester_Domes @EpiEllie @ConiByera @LucyStats @AlexaYakubovich @AnjaLeist @rohitpojha @AbbyCScience @_MiguelHernan @casualinfer If you are asking me whether I ultimately want a function Y(x) -- not necessarily; in some problems I would be happy with just E[Y(23)/Y(7)]. In SCM you get the whole function for free. In Harvard you can't talk about Y(x) w/o some Y(x') to feel part of the RCT culture.#Bookofwhy
