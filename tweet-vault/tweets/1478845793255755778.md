@_WEEXIAO @Vlad_S @drfeifei @GaryMarcus @yudapearl @neurobongo @TimKietzmann @demishassabis @sama @ilyasut @koraykv @AndrewYNg Human brain in clearly more flexible in many ways than AI/animals.Although agree with @ylecun that we need pre-linguistic world models.These will also directly power the type of reasoning you are imagining.IMO flexible/general sensor level knowledge is still the bottleneck
