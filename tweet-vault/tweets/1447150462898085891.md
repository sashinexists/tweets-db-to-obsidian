Thanks for the quotes.Lately, it has occurred to me that there are hundreds of words in common discourse which reflect comparison to alternate realities. Take eg the words "Thank you", or "Bless you" or "It's wonderful". Bless God for this ability to envision alternate realities. https://t.co/AMYL5eTszf
