A similar distinction divides ML and CI styles of research. ML papers rarely ask: What should the world be like for my algorithm to work, or, "Is my task doable?". These questions are the key for CI papers, eg. "Are the model assumptions sufficient for answering a given query?" https://t.co/yKV6ULfxOE
