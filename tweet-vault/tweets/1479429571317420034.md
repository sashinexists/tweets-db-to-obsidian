@ntraft @_WEEXIAO @Vlad_S @drfeifei @GaryMarcus @tejasdkulkarni @neurobongo @TimKietzmann @demishassabis @sama @ilyasut @koraykv @AndrewYNg @danilobzdok Agree. The symbols vs. gradient-based debate does not address the more basic question of information content: Do the data available contain the information needed for estimating the query asked? The reason it's rarely asked in ML (unlike CI) is absence of a theory to answer it.
