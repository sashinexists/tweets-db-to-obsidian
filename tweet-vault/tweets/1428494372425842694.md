@analisereal @instrumenthull @pablogerbas @alexpghayes @seanjtaylor @MatheusFacure @yudapearl @analisereal, I would just add: use both if u want/need- if the query is only interventional, this is not necessary. Still, I am not sure what @instrumenthull  referred to as "bits of PO". Is it clear what is excluded from the graph-approach that he would like to see represented?
