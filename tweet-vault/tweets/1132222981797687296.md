@SamerAbdelnour @mszargar @AsraNomani I was right. You cannot bring yourself to say the words "equally indigenous" and you admit that SJP and the entire Palestinian leadership still deny the right of my people to a homeland in any borders. This is what I meant by "victim's cover." A cover for a plan of elimination.
