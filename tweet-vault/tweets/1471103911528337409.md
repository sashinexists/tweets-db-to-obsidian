@stephensenn @JasonConnorPhD @AndrewPGrieve @jd_wilko @f2harrell @soboleffspaces Your interpretation of the observational study is correct. These are actual observed rates. Same as in the experimental study, except that here we interpret the rates as "effects". Drug refusers, fearing side-effects, simply refrain from taking anything.
