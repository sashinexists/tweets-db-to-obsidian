@PhilHaile @steventberry @lewbel @causalinf @PHuenermund @econbookclub @Chris_Auld @analisereal @jdramirezc Agree on substance. But should a field like economics permit confusion to persist, when the relationship between counterfactuals and structure is so lucidly given in Eq. (4.5) of https://t.co/Sf5yw328zl, and so clearly computed in Sec. 4.2.4, for both cyclic and acyclic systems?
