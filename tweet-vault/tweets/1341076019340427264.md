@PhilHaile @VC31415 @JaapAbbring @Chris_Auld @DonskerClass @lewbel @steventberry The reason I am eager to hear about "something else" is that I would like to know if SCM should be enriched with new capabilities. I would appreciate the idea behind the "something else", namely how the needed assumptions are of totally difference nature, beyond SCM.
