To all readers who celebrate it, Merry Christmas from me and from my family in Jerusalem. I fell in love with Christmas the moment we arrived to US, 1960, primarily b/c it reminded me so much of Hanuka as it was celebrated in my home town, with songs and lights from every window. https://t.co/d4lN5qzpLj
