@JaapAbbring @edwinleuven @yudapearl Supply and Demand functions are potential outcomes by  definition, but things get fuzzy when we speak of potential outcomes for market price/quantities, when dealing with nonequilibrium interventions such as different price-setting mechanism. SEMs did fine for 100 years w/o POs.
