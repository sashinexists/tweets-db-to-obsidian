1/ Your question deserves more than a twitter blip but, for now, I would say YES, P(Y=y|do(X=x)) is a "measure" of "manipulative causation", with two qualifications: (1) It applies to non-manipulable X as well, and (2) It's a population-level measure as opposed to unit-level, https://t.co/xWOhjXOUc6
