@iwashyna @EpiEllie @yudapearl @eddericu @Amy_Bohnert @Research_ICU @NEJM @_MiguelHernan 2/2 If yes, I am not sure how could obfuscating what is the target of the analysis, Y_x, by a generic name, could help. We know that inference from P(Z, X, Y) to P(Yx) needs assumptions about Yx; How could one articulate and even judge these assumptions w/o evoking the quant, Yx?
