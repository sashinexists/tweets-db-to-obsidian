@AlexChinco @amt_shrma @analisereal @maximananyev @Jabaluck @eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @PACESconsulting @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @HeerJeet For sure. My point is just that if seating is totally randomized there is no effect of college on voting -- the first link in the front door chain is broken. So seating has to be *conditionally* random given college, with different propensity scores. Maybe that's so?
