@RWJE_BA @dylanarmbruste3 @soboleffspaces @yudapearl @nickchk @Lizstuartdc @PWGTennant I guess you misunderstood my point. Causality cannot be inferred from observational data alone, I definitely agree. Correlation can. Thatâ€™s why (e.g. ML) people who rely only on observational data actually rely only on correlation and thus get mislead.
