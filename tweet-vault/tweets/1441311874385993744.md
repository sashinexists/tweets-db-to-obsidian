@joarhalvorsen @tkaiser_science A non-responder is someone who has the same outcome that the person would have had anyway without treatment (counterfactual). Baseline is an unreliable counterfactual unless we assume that each person's condition would remain forever unchanged but for treatmentâ€”which is unlikely.
