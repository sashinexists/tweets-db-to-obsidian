Not assuming a specific model is forgiven - you dont want to introduce unwanted bias. The question is whether not assuming ANY probability distribution  penalizes you. In CI it would be devastating, for it would prevent us from proving that some model-blind tasks are impossible. https://t.co/GxtUwZA2OX
