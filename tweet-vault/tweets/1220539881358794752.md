Hey @yudapearl I’m reading Book of Why and stumbled over this passage (pict1). It’s very odd, though, that the first page of Euclidean Elements lists this (pict2). You sound very assured on book, and I’m very confused now. Is it just a big mistake or am I loosing something here? https://t.co/3AhtZy0h7G
