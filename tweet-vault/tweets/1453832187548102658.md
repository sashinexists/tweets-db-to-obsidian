@DKedmey @yudapearl @EinatWilf You’re free to believe whatever you want. It doesn’t make it true.
Zionists who immigrated to Palestine and are not Jewish Palestinians are NOT indigenous, they are settlers. And their settler colonial role is amplified by their dominance over the native population of Palestine.
