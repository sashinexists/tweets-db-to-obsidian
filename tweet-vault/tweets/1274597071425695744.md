1/ I am always amazed at the depth of wisdom this verse radiates: "Thou shall not oppress the stranger, because you were once a stranger in the land of Egypt" (Exodus 22:21). Meaning: collective memory is the basis of ethics and values, personal experience is not rich enough. 1/2 https://t.co/SFZx0Wct1O
