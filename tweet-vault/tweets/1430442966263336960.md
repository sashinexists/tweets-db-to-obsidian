One additional comment: My last sentence says: How CI can benefit from this enhanced mode of learning, which goes opposite to the motto of Benjo's talk: How ML can incorporate CI. Reason: CI already has the conceptual framework for causal thinking; ML may enhance, not replace it. https://t.co/js7mZ4sOjC
