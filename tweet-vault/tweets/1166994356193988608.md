@causalinf @Undercoverhist As tribute to the great fun we had today, I would like to dedicate a day each month to meet with potential authors of economics textbooks. Authors better be: 1) Tenured, ie free of peer pressures 2) Aspiring to brighten up the dark sides of econometric education  #Bookofwhy
