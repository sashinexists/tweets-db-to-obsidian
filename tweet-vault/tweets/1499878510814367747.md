@soboleffspaces @stephensenn @ADAlthousePhD @f2harrell @SMuellerLab Assuming they wish to learn the language of causality. From what I see on tweeter, the trialist community is likely to be the last to do it; which is unfortunate, I have hoped they would all jump in glee upon realizing what they can do with minor tweaking. Luckily, some do jump.
