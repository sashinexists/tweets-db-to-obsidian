@yudapearl @bgoncalves @fitelson First, I am tickled pink to be discussed by this trio. Hope I can jump in with my perspective. Simpson's paradox can lead to 1) non-generalizable models making wrong predictions on held-out data; 2) wrong explanations leading to bad interventions; 3) unfair predictions.
