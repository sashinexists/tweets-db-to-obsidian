@yudapearl @adibzaman @eliasbareinboim @tdietterich I talk a bit about AI work on learning causal intuitive physics (e.g.,  Tenenbaum) and the role of causal models in transfer learning (e.g., Kansky et al., "Schema Networks").     I do mention "Book of Why" but don't go into the details, since my book is not at all technical.
