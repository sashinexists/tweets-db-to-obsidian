@ingorohlfing @yudapearl @tomdrabowicz ... my experience was from the very beginning our training in "Methodology/Philosophy of Social Science" was a systematic intertwining of questions of epistemological, logical, theoretical modeling and empirical testing, including the identification of "causation". Whats new?
