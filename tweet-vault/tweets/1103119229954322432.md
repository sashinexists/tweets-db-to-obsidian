@omaclaren @edwardhkennedy @analisereal @BreskinEpi Once a causal parameter is identifiable you forget about it being "causal". Dress it up as a "statistical" parameter, and ask "Is estimation possible?" as if it came from a respectable statistical textbook. Causality plays no role in making the estimation hard or easy. #Bookofwhy
