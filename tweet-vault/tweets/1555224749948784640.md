@EliSennesh @yahia2s @yudapearl @JenChangeFL Haha I promise you I am not remotely fixated on or even in agreement with that assumption. I'm just against using ethnic cleansing and disenfranchisement to create electoral majorities for any ethnic group. Palestinians under Israeli control need a vote in Israeli elections
