@pablogerbas @instrumenthull @lewbel This is an interesting new twist. So, the word "design" comes from the assumed randomization of some instrument. What about exclusion restriction, is it "design-based" or "model-based"? What about "fusion-models" which allow us to combine experimental and observational data.
