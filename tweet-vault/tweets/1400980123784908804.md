Very interesting discussion. My take: You might be able to do it all using two primitives: (1) exogeneity and (2) correlation. Unfortunately, no one has done it yet formally, going from clearly defined input to the target answer: yes or no. DAGs give it to us. Havn't seen others. https://t.co/ijj7klv5Oc
