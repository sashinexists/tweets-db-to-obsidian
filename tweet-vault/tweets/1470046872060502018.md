@yudapearl @soboleffspaces @stephensenn @AndrewPGrieve @PavlosMsaouel @f2harrell Yes. Give us something we can use in the clinic.

Eg. RCTs of antidepressants average a difference between placebo and active treatment of 17%. NNT=6.

Please give us a better way of sharing that fact so patients can choose what they want.
