@yudapearl @causalinf @PHuenermund @econbookclub @steventberry @Chris_Auld @analisereal @jdramirezc @PhilHaile When you decide to buy a widget you look at its price. It's algebraically equivalent to say you instead look at all the things that determined that price, but the latter is not what you *actually* do. Structural, behavioral equations are supposed to be what you actually do.
