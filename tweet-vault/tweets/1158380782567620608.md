@doinkboy @GRich_Cinci @Ben_C_J @NicoleBarbaro This is what causal inference is all about: "interpret it causal, given a set of assumptions (i.e., a causal model)."
Except that the "interpretation" is no longer whimsical, as it used to be, it must obey the logic of causation. And this is what makes it "causal" #Bookofwhy
