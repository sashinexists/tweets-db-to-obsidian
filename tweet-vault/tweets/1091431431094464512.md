@SFMagus @schmarzo @Grady_Booch @pacoid I was quite involved in DST, late 1980's, and even wrote two summary papers: https://t.co/g4ta2ayhZz and  https://t.co/4Zzj5ZBvdc. Readers of #Bookofwhy would have fun trying DST on the Monty Hall problem and seeing it fail. Lesson: always try your theory on a toy example.
