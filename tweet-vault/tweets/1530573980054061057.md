@erikphoel @philipcball @newscientist @renzocom I'm referring to PS, PN, and PNS which, although they involve probabilities, cannot be expressed by the language of probabilities alone (Rung-1), without counterfactuals, which are Rung-3. It is the counterfactual component that tells you where they emerge from.
