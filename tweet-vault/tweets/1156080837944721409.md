@Jabaluck @yudapearl @fuzzydunlop123 @erinhengel @PHuenermund Hi everyone!
 
Recently, I have seen several things that applied Econ papers do that could be improved with DAG thinking.

1. Controlling for post-instrument confounders. AJR 2001 is the most famous examples, but even very recent papers in IO literature do this.
