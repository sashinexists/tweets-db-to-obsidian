@causalinf @steventberry @paulgp @lewbel @Undercoverhist Lewbel's taxonomy notwithstanding, "Design" cannot replace "identification". "Design" connotes an option an analyst may or may not choose, "identification" is a property of your model; a causal query is either identifiable or not (given the model) no matter what you do.#Bookofwhy
