My beloved wife was laid to rest on Thursday, next to our son, Danny, overlooking San Fernando Valley. I am grateful for the flood of condolences and support that you sent my way, which I wish I could acknowledge it in person. Will be back soon with renewed explorations of "WHY". https://t.co/AxHWhwWDwP
