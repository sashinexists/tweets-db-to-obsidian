@economeager @statsepi @Emma_C_Clarke But before that DISCLAIMER TIME! I am going to be making overly broad statements about epi vs. econ. None of this is binary, and insert a mental "are more likely to" everywhere. I am also more econ than epi. That could be considered a perspective/bias/whatever.
