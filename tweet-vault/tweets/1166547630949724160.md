@emc2G @DanzigMD @Ilhan @RashidaTlaib @PeterBeinart @DanzigMD compared David Duke racism to the racist rhetoric and activities of Rashida Tlaib. Ashrawi and Miftah are more sophisticated, they know how to apologize once the damage is done. I have not heard Tlaib apologize for her Zionophobic outbursts. She can't! betray her base.
