@maximananyev @Jabaluck @analisereal @eliasbareinboim @autoregress @PACESconsulting @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @HeerJeet I am not a bit surprised. "front-door" is one of many models involving 3 variables and one latent confounder, so i am sure it came up naturally in many applications. The fact that it permits nonparametric identification, came as a shock to statisticians (narrated in #Bookofwhy)
