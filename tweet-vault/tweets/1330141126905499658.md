This is a commercial, you can skip. How do I know that I've written a damn good book? Simple, I enjoy reading it even 2 years after publication. In fact I was thrilled to read it today, after @Joscani mentioned S. Wright and his lonely stand against the statistical establishment. https://t.co/RryRS2Mg1B
