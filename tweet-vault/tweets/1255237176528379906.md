@raj_mehta @YFeyman @ProfHayward @WSJopinion @causalinf Good point. I could imagine conversations like those we are witnessing on Twitter going on w/o the language of DAGs to facilitate them. Even devout antaginsts of DAGs are using expressions such as "there are many paths from X to Y" "going only through W" etc. It speaks a lot.
