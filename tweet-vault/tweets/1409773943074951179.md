This reminds me how in 1961, a year after coming to this country, I took a taxi with a Hungarian driver who could not stop talking and, when I came home, I could only utter three words: "They actually exist". My Israeli naivete was shattered; my teachers said: "They once existed" https://t.co/4IdOcmAGvs
