@GaryMarcus @yudapearl @emilymbender Indeed; we are not focusing on a semantics/interpretation of current DL. I recur to history: in the past, we’ve missed it in CS, but the field evolved significantly w.r.t. formal semantics; it’s positive that this debate is beginning to flourish. @AvilaGarcez @plevy @kerstingAIML
