@yudapearl @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @Jabaluck @HeerJeet But this is indeed a useful example, because it illustrates a slightly-more-complex application of front-door logic than napkin which has a "design-based" justification (RCT + clerk) and which we might have a hard time specifying without drawing a DAG. Progress! Thank you.
