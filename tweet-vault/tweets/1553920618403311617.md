I would stick to "mimicking" as long as no one explains to me what she means by "ACTUAL phenomenal consciousness". (Recall, faking it is having it, because it's so hard to fake w/o having) And I wouldn't knock "symbol manipulation according to rules" - this is how my brain works. https://t.co/k14SnwCU6B
