I am wondering how many ML students know that A/B test is jargon for RCT, estimating E(Y|do(x)), while OPE estimates E(Y|x), hence it's way off. I used to think it's just a matter of translation. I'ts deeper. In ML you rarely find algorithms characterized by what they estimate. https://t.co/dqytxofvni
