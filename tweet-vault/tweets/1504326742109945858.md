@psychunseen @UmarN91 @yudapearl A proper *causal* model with experiments to gather the right data. The data may already be available- as it was for lung cancer &amp; smoking - you just need someone to have the knowledge to suggest a mechanism &amp; then the guts to design experiments. Check out @yudapearlâ€™s book.
