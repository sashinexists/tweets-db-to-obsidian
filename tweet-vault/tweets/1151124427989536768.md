@omaclaren @AndersHuitfeldt @yudapearl Yes. This is what I had in mind. Or suppose in my DAG that U is a functional relationship: U = X*sin(Z) and that Y = \beta*U. What approach (other than somehow specifying U correctly) would yield the correct policy implications of doing X in the presence of different Z's?
