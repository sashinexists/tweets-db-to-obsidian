The Guardian is right. Israel would have been a different country today had it been given a chance to develop organically, with normal neighbors, w/o having to defend it existence on a daily basis. The Guardian sadly is a willing partner to this continuous denial of normalcy. https://t.co/Ky0SvfyCuT
