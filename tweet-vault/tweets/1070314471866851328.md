@eddericu @EpiEllie @zshahn @_MiguelHernan 3/3 ..the significance of reducing a query Q to a do-expression. Once we do this,
we are guaranteed (1) Q is experimentally estimable, (2) Q is observationally estimable if do-calculus says so, (3) If it says so, it tells you how. Teaching from PRIMER makes everything clear. Thx
