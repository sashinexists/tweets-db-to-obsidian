@eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @CsabaSzepesvari @mendel_random The truth is, I think DAGs are useful for lots of things, including providing counterexamples to ignorability claims. Graphical criteria that you can use in conjunction with the ignorability (say Tyler and Ilya's disjunctive cause criterion) are great.
