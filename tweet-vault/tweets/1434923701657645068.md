@Sergei_Imaging @zacharylipton @yudapearl @tdietterich Agreed.  When I use/hear the term 'distribution shift', my thinking around it is causal: I envision a situation where the distribution of a variable may change, but the underlying causal dynamics stay the same.  The issue is not the term, but the understanding around it.
