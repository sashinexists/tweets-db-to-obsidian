@DJMinded @ADL @ajc @HillelIntl Having problem with policies is never anti-Semitic, and you would rarely find me using this word now that we have a more specific term: Zionophobia.
I would also check my information, in case it is generated by Zionophobic sources, say Al-Jazeera, CAIR spokesmen, and some media.
