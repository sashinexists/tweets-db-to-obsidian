@zacharylipton @eliasbareinboim @CsabaSzepesvari @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @ShalitUri I would be very curious to know how "all the recent papers" escape a theoretical impediment. We need conceptual guidance from someone who read them (who?)  Do they "assume ignorability" like Imbens&amp;Co.?
Do they invoke a causal model? Do they discover equivalence model classes?
