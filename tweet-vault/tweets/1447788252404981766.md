Viewed from different perspective, this prize brings a great honor to Israel, which has just increased the number of its Nobel Laurates in economics from two (Robert Aumann and Daniel Kahneman) to three (Angrist is Israeli-American). 

Not bad for a country under perpetual siege. https://t.co/MB6ixGdxgw
