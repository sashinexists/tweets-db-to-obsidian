@Jabaluck @yudapearl @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal Let's call it a day, Jason. I don't think this will lead to anything. Let me just say this and then I'm off: In our previous exchanges you were repeatedly asking for examples of papers. Now we have one and I don't find our discussion any more illuminating. It's a bit frustrating.
