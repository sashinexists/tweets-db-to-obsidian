@Nayborhoodbully @ZachLewis3187 @isaacdecastrog @CAIRNational @bandlersbanter @HenMazzig @ADL I believe the world would forgive CAIR for past stupidities if they only state: "Zionist synagogues are NOT our enemies". As simple as that. But they won't, because they can't, they would lose their entire membership.
