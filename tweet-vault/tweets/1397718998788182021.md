Thanks, Ken. Now I can tell you my criticism of "Frames". You treat "mental models" as uniquely human, while for me, and for most AI-ers, they are pointers to existing human capabilities that are begging for computer simulation, and will soon be algorithmicized. Read my lips. https://t.co/HCLvgjA02G
