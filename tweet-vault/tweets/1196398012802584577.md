Sport tends to make miracles: First time I hear the Israeli anthem (Hatikva = "The Hope") played by Arab musicians, sending shivers in my spine. It's fusing two hopes: (1) "to be a free nation" and (2) to make peace with our neighbors. The first is 2,000 yrs old, the second 71. https://t.co/krVysgyRqs
