@eliasbareinboim @statwonk @yudapearl @PHuenermund This is an interesting question - I’ll have to think about it. Note tho that the model we set up would follow a hierarchical format - ie we would start from variables in physical past (spatiotemporal pathways, here your arrows) and simulate forward. We couldn’t simulate otherwise
