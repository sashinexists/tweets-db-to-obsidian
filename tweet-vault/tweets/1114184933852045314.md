@autoregress @eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @juli_schuess @CarterPaddy To summarize: 
1) Problem is solvable in PO. 
2) Problem is easier to solve with DAGs than PO. 
3) Are problems meeting criteria 1) and 2) important for economists in practice? That is an open question. My guess: "Yes, there are some" but not, "They arise all the time"
