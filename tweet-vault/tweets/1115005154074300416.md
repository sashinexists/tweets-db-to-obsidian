@HannesMalmberg1 @autoregress @eliasbareinboim @juli_schuess @CarterPaddy Theory is easy as long as you have 4 variables in the canonical template. Add a nuance and simplicity is shaken. Add one "control variable" (ie conditional IV) and theory is helpless, experts are embarrassed and must resort to: "how often has it happened in practice". #Bookofwhy
