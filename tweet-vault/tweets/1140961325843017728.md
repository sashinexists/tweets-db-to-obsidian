@gjcampitelli @Lester_Domes @Corey_Yanofsky @stephensenn @omaclaren @_MiguelHernan I would stick to my SCM religion: Solutions must start by articulating the questions. What do we mean by "handling"? What are we expected to do after we differentiate between FE and RE in the model construction? Or, put more bluntly, why would anyone care? #Bookofwhy
