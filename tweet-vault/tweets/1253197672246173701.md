@autoregress @yudapearl @Jabaluck @gelbach @HeerJeet (2/2) Stating what we need for some result to be valid  is, of course, very useful. But that's a different task from, given an applied problem, being able to formally represent what we know. That's the gap we are missing, which is currently bridged by verbal explanations usually.
