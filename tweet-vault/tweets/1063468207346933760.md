@statwonk @0xeinar @johnmyleswhite @OseinaR I would love to agree on everything, but I need to understand what the grievances are: "blindspots" "systematic errors", "land grab""ridicuouls claims" "absurd" "classic case" "pushing back". What is all this commotion
about? Can we first do things right and then debate sources?
