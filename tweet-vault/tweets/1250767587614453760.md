Here is how Richard Feynman explains why molecules speed up when gas is compressed. About 5-6 minutes into this video https://t.co/lFA4PWDQe7 he explains how a gas molecule, fairly stupid one, knows that it must increase it kinetic energy to make up for the work done on the gas. https://t.co/grMzv0JmY9
