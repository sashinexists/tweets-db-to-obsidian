It's reassuring to know that the ancestral linkage of modern Arabs to ancient Canaanites was invented 20-30 years before Erekat. Western "scholars" swallowed it like discovering New Atlantis; none asked: Do your children know anything about Canaanites? A hero? A fable? A poem? https://t.co/iHoUIRae6t
