@omaclaren @alexeidrummond @Lester_Domes @PavlosMsaouel @cubic_logic @neuro_data @KordingLab @Lizstuartdc @BetsyOgburn @yudapearl They don't allow for feedback loops, thus a DAG would tell you such bullshit as "the external electric field which causes the polarization of the dielectric", while obviously the electric field of the dielectric influences the external electric field just as much. 2/n
