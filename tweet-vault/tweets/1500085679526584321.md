@stephensenn @ADAlthousePhD @f2harrell @soboleffspaces @SMuellerLab Mr. Hyde: Why listen to them? They (CI) don't 
         even know what concurrent control is!
Dr. Jekyll: They know, they just have a formal 
        word for it P(Y_1-Y_0|S) which allows
       them to understand what they obtain from 
       the study, and how to improve on it!
