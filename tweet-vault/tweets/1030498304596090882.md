@eliasbareinboim @EpiEllie @yudapearl @l__ds @malco_barrett @NeuroStats @ken_rothman I don’t think the pie helps with identification here. The DAG tells you all you need. The pies describe something finer than the DAG but I don’t think that extra fineness is identified in most cases. Also, to correct my previous comment, V&amp;R’s formula doesn’t need monotonicity.
