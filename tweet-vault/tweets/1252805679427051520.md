@autoregress @gelbach I think this was just a simple mix-up. @HeerJeet doesn't understand that there is a distinction between economists and the people he sees on cable news telling you what stocks to buy, and @yudapearl would cheer on an anthropomorphic turd if it endorsed a view he currently holds.
