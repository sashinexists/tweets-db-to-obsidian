@HenningStrandin @neuro_data In Cartwright time, philosophers were invoking temporal information in attempting to prolong the hope of reductionism. Today, we know that temporal information can't help, as shown by the M-bias model, so the impossibility of reductionism (to probability) became a theorem.
