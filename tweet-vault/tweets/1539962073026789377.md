@yudapearl @BDSBoston @BDSmovement The @BDSmovement didn't seem to express criticism of "Boston Mapping Project" until FBI showed interest 

Of course in their statement disowning what they likely helped hatch they did try to turn the criticism around, suggesting they should get a free pass for hateful behavior
