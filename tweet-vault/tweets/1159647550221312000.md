@yudapearl @causalinf @steventberry @paulgp @lewbel @Undercoverhist The model where the variation in years of schooling comes from, "Some people won a lottery that grants them four extra years of schooling and some people did not" will generally be more credible than the DAG where you close backdoor paths between schooling and earnings.
