Agree-great episode of SERious Epi w/@UCSF_Epibiostat alum Dr. Megha Mehrotra, reminiscing about reading @yudapearl while in Yosemite. Also, @Megtron9 I want to have an argument w/ you and @EpidByDesign re this "internal/external doesn't matter- it's all target validity" advice. https://t.co/cwYvI6ofc5
