I don't think you read me (and UAE) correctly. We are saying "Zionism is coexistence" and, axiomatically, coexistence means "free Palestine," side by side w/ Israel.
So, where did you get the "you do not let" idea? We are celebrating Nov 29, Sunday, a commitment to COEXISTENCE. https://t.co/YxNcQxIjL0
