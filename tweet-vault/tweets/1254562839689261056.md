@stuartbuck1 @PHuenermund @quantadan @maximananyev 4/4 or scenario, or a model, or a story, or whatever helps you discern whether the statement holds true or not. No need to be pedantic on issues such as "strong ignorability" vs. "weak ignorability", or how Z was chosen. Just examining the problem and deciding true of false.
