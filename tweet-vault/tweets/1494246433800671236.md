@DavidDeutschOxf @BobbyAzarian @mpigliucci @erikphoel @WiringTheBrain @philipcball @ArletOttens @jamessseattle @SMcfarnell @NeuroMinded @PsychToday @Sara_Imari @danieldennett @skdh @SamHarrisOrg @bgreene @danfalk I fully agree. An AGI, if successful, would be a decisive proof that there is no contradiction between "All is pre-determined" and "Permission is always granted". But do we really need to wait for full AGI? Can't we formulate the principles by which it can be done? We should.
