@artistexyz @ted43062045 @melbatutor @causalinf @Susan_Athey @EconometricaEd The strand of PO currently thriving in economics has two deficiencies: (1) No graphs to facilitate inferences (via d-separation) and (2) No structure to illuminate assumptions. It is surviving, like the monarchy, only because it is erroneously supposed to do no harm.
