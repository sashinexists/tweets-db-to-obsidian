@hmatejx @yudapearl @stephensenn Nops! this is a fallacy from CI folks and @yudapearl book. Experimentation and observation is not the same framework. You can use the same notation as they do, but this is not the same from the methodologival point of view. Is one of the many important idea of the EBM movement.
