@yudapearl @ZachWritesStuff @CNNSotu @jaketapper It’s right wing talking point b/c it’s used to shut down any debate on Palestinian rights and Israel’s human rights violations. Basically to gaslight and smear someone to turn the whole convo into about that rather than current affairs. Like the demolition of the houses n Gaza.
