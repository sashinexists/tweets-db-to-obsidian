@stevesphd @eliasbareinboim @mendel_random @jwbelmon DAGs are there to help you precisely at this stage of your "real life" problem, by allowing you to explicate what you DO and DON'T know about that "life". Once you do that, you can view the DAG as a TOY, and turn to enjoy "real-life" again. #Bookofwhy
