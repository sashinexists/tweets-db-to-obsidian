Conservation laws do not satisfy our quest for causal explanation. Does a molecule know that it needs to conserve energy? So what makes it speed up in a Venturi pipe? Or when gas is compressed? Feynman always preferred putting himself "in the shoes" of those molecules. Me too. https://t.co/bNXPIQKCoI
