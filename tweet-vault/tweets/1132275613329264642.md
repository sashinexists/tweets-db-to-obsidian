@SamerAbdelnour @mszargar @AsraNomani Calling people "settler colonialists" does not make them less indigenous than your family. Those "colonialists", remember,  recite poetry written in that land, in the language spoken in that land, by heroes ruling that land. By dismissing their claims you diminish yours.
