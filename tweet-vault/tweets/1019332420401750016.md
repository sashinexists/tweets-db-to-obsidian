@HFstudy @fgomollon @_MiguelHernan @KatieJSheehan @pierreguyubc I agree with the spirit of your message, but the term "observational study"
was defined (by Cochran) in no other context but that of "causal inference". See https://t.co/zMepynHLai "Causal Inference in the Twilight Zone" #bookofwhy #epibookclub #causalinference
