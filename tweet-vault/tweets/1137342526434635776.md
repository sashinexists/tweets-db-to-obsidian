@jd_wilko @HarvardEpi 3/3 by "imitating RCT's". It is a tough umbilical chord to cut. Denis Lindley was the only statistician I met who said: CUT! In all these schemes we still need to import information from outside the data, which is the key to realizing that we are out of the stat-womb. #Bookofwhy
