@gottfriedmath @yudapearl What exactly is causal asymmetry? A dependency graph is a set of directional dependencies pa(V)→V. The ordering of V defines the factorization of the distribution P(v). Pearl attached the label ‘causal’ to DAGs with invariant P(a|pa(A)) for A in X\V when X are set to constant x.
