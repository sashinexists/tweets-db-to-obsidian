@tdietterich @yudapearl @MarcioMinicz Assuming "sending a message" a domain (which hopefully siri knows) try asking 

"if i dont receive a call from XYZ by today evening then send him a reminder tomorrow morning about our saturday's meeting."

Siri "understands" only what it is programmed to understand.
