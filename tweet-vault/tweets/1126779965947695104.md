@dan_marinazzo @atypical_me @KordingLab So, the testable prediction of A→B in a model M1 obtained on data D1 per DCM would read
"any model you can fit to D1 that does not have A→B will either be more complex or less accurate than M1"?

So the testable prediction is about model performances not future new datapoints?
