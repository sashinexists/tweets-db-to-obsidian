@eliasbareinboim @EpiEllie @iwashyna @yudapearl @Amy_Bohnert @Research_ICU @NEJM @_MiguelHernan By thinking through the target trial, one is more likely to have a "well-defined" intervention, i.e. positivity, consistency, exchangeability are followed. See Does Water Kill? https://t.co/Eiv3HQdjMk e.g. One could put "Water" as the interv., but that would break PO consistency
