@pablogerbas @PHuenermund @JonNichEdwards More precisely, all POs are generally called "potential outcomes", to declare owenership to  Rubin (1974) as distinct from the philosophical literature (Lewis, Stalnaker, 1973) and SCM (1991)
where they are shown to be derivable from more basic relationships, w/  no treatments.
