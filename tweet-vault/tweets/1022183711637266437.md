@_MiguelHernan @yudapearl @aynumazi @Harvard Me: https://t.co/OeWicGQJFS. Finding one identification condition for sequential treatments is not the same as a causal calculus (that should enable one to solve several problems). As a litmus test, how would you use the tools of the 1986 paper to solve the napkin problem above?
