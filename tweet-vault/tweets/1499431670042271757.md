@stephensenn @yudapearl @f2harrell @soboleffspaces @SMuellerLab Humorously enough, this misunderstanding has appeared before, with people who seem to believe that the solution to “balance” issues in trials is to keep randomizing the patients until the groups are better balanced, not realizing that patients don’t all just appear at once.
