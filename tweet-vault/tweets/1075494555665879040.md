More accurately, the PO framework is split between Rubin-PO and Epi-Harvard-PO (EHPO). The latter (correct me @EpiEllie) welcomes graphs but restricts all causes to be "well-defined interventions", eg, disallowing sex, earthquakes  and blood-pressure.#Bookofwhy #causalinference https://t.co/v98qYWvcxW
