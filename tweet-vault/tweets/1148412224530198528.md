@stephensenn @yudapearl It's hard to reconcile both claims, ie, (1) you understand ch. 4 &amp; (2) your implication that someone in CI claimed that DoE is not about causality.  To make it crisper: (i) DoE provides a method to learn some causal relations; (ii) There is still much more to modern CI than DoE.
