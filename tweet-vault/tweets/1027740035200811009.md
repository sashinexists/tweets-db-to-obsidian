@yudapearl @malco_barrett @NeuroStats @l__ds @ken_rothman Thanks. I think there’s some miscommunication though. Causal pies aren’t about how to estimate interactions; they provide a way to visualize how interactions could/not arise. In DAGs, if interactions are always assumed, then is there no way to visualize an absence of interaction?
