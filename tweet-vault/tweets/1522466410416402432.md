I am not sure it's wise to call them "sick, barbaric society", because it implies that up until seeing their celebration we thought they act as "healthy, humane and reasonable" society. If we thought that way, why couldn't Israel make peace with these humane and rational people? https://t.co/s7TauMegjb
