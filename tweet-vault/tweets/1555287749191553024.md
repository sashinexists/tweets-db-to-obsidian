I was  happy to see the @ADL's report pointing to the danger of anti-Zionist candidates. Alas, the only fault @ADL finds in those candidates is invoking "Jewish power and control" rhetoric. Does @ADL deem Anti-Zionism in itself to be a legitimate form of bigotry? @JGreenblattADL https://t.co/Aak6Q0lXeP
