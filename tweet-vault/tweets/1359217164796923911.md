Machine learning folks were way ahead of me begging for "explainable ML". But I am not sure even today they have internalized that there is no such a thing as "explainable" program w/o a model of reality. You can explain the program's data-fitting strategy but not why it matters. https://t.co/x8y71qbLfD
