As much as I think Israel’s settlement project is its greatest folly, this much is true: they are not illegal. To use the case of the forced transfer of Jews and others to Nazi occupied Poland as basis to argue Israel’s settlements are of the same kind was always an abomination. https://t.co/nT1XNI154Q
