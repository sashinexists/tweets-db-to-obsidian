@zaffama @tdietterich @BomNaKub @roydanroy The do(x) operator describes an action executed under experimental conditions, making it independent of all factors which may also affect the outcome. If you really took the aspirin by flipping a coin, you would write P(Y_x'=y'|Y_x=y) which is similar to PN but not exactly.
