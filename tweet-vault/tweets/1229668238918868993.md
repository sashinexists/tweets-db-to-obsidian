@DKedmey @DavidDeutschOxf @yudapearl @EinatWilf @sapinker @LRNR this is my idea, not David's. i think Jews r a disturbg ppl bc they question received truths. this criticism is viewed by gentiles (&amp; some jews) as offensive if not worse &amp; the ability to tell jews to mind thr ps&amp;qs is an essential "right". "The Pattern" establishes that right.
