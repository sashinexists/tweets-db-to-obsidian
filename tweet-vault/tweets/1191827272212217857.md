@AdanZBecerra1 @fledglingStat @robertstats @stephensenn These are good heuristics but insufficient. Adjusting for vars that are associated w outcome but not exposure may actually increase standard errors AND change causal effect. The rule is: Do not use statistical vocabulary when speaking "effect", or even "outcome",  use #Bookofwhy
