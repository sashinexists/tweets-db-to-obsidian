I have a matching question, #epitwitter:

In cohort studies, matching is supposed to control for confounding so you donâ€™t need to adjust for the matching factors, but in case-control studies, matching just improves efficiency &amp; you still need to adjust for matching factors... 1/3 https://t.co/QLx3qP8tEp
