@JonathanCorbin2 @joshrfeldman @statwonk Blood libels are not funny either, they actually kill. I am surprised that people upholding decency and sensitivity would tolerate words such as "Israel committing ethnic genocide" and, numbed by repetition, would not jump to the ceiling with condemnations and disgust.
