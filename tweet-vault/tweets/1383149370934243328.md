@yudapearl @CarlosCinelli Still I find the subject smwht confusing;  you seem to identify the “single case” with an instance of the U vars. But that is not necessarily a unit of the population, as you explain here: https://t.co/0dW438JafY. In that sense, a counterfactual may not tell about an actual unit.
