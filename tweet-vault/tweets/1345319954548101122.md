@DavidRouquie @BrianWandell The neglect was surprising until we proved that Cartwright's dictum "no causes in, no causes out" is actually a theorem, not merely a recurring phenomenon. At that point, the data-centric culture ceased to be an exploration of possibilities &amp; became a confession of impossibility.
