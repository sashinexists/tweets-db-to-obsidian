I am careful NOT to pose questions in terms of DAGs, that would be cheating.
The questions I asked are generic, e.g., which parameter in YOUR model can be estimated using OLS? I dont care if  they use DAGs or not to answer such important questions - I am surprised they dont care. https://t.co/vvcMkns8Gl
