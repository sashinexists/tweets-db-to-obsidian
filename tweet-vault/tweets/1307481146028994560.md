@BetsyOgburn @CasualBrady @yudapearl @diogo_pernes That's correct, but they can be necessary within a specified class of models. In this case, considering the class M of nonparametric models described only by a graph G, the absence of a bidirected edge between X and any of its children is a necessary condition for identification.
