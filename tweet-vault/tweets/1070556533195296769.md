@jon_y_huang @robertwplatt @EpiEllie @zshahn @_MiguelHernan Thanks for the papers. I have (delinquently) skipped this literature because I could not find a simple interpretation of the quantity being estimated, rNDE; I am still unable to find it in the papers. Perhaps you have one? Indeed its one way of approximating R-3 by R-2 substit.
