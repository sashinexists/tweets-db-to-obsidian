@dylanarmbruste3 @yudapearl @soboleffspaces @noah_greifer @causalinf @EpiEllie @bveg3 In RCT in general the research question is much more clear and nitid than in obs. studies. Of course you can use obs. data when you have a decision problem in clini al practice... But again, in general this is ineficcient, old, deprected and even unethical way to do that.
