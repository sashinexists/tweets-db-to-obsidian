I was bought up dreaming about the 1947 map, then 1948 map, then, after Khartoum's "three no's" (1967) we had to wait and hear how our neighbors intend to use their state. Thus far, they continue to promise us rockets and eventual annihilation -- we are still waiting though. https://t.co/RlZovBOKNb
