Feeling a bit bummed out by all the racism I have to deal with on this site.

It feels so excessive given I mostly tweet about math and statistics not politics.

So many people on here canâ€™t see past my skin color.

They make up wild statements about me and question my humanity. https://t.co/7VxzWv479P
