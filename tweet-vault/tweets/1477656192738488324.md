@nltmcd @yudapearl Really? Is he talking about regularity in ontological or epistemological sense? Objects in his definition of cause, did he mean worldly, material things or ideas in the mind? Didnâ€™t he dismiss Treatise as a juvenile work, insisting "doctrines are better illustrated in Enquiry"?
