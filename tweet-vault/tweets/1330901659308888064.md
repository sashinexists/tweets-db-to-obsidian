@thefeministcop @zeemo_n @Shade_Nox @EinatWilf Great Try! But you won't make it in Yemen. You know why? Because you do not have the historical connection that it takes to make you "indigenous". Morocco tried it with Spain, but no Moroccan youth could remember Spanish landscape good enough to campaign for a "return to Spain."
