@yudapearl @amitabhchandra2 It seems that DAGs took off in fields with less tradition of causal inference. When researchers are regressing heart attacks on avocado consumption w/ no thought to causality, itâ€™s easy to see how DAGs can bring a lot of value. Less obvious in disciplines w long CI traditions
