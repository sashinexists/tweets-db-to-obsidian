@brunofmr @eliasbareinboim This is the first time I hear the phrases "obviously true" and "controversial" applied to the same object, with the exception of Copernicus heliocentric theory. Curious, what aspect of the hierarchy is controversial to someone who takes the time to understand what it means.
