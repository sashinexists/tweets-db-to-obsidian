@omaclaren @Lester_Domes @EpiEllie @ConiByera @LucyStats @AlexaYakubovich @AnjaLeist @rohitpojha @AbbyCScience @_MiguelHernan @casualinfer I can't really speak for what the others want. I know that many expressed suspicion of a creature named Y(x), or even E[Y(x)], because (my conjecture) Harvard's graduates are trained, born and conceived in RCT, all else is suspect. TT fashion is part of this culture #Bookofwhy
