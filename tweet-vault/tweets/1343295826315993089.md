@yudapearl @ShalitUri @VC31415 @CasualBrady I got my PhD at Berkeley, and there is an amazing causal reading group covering diverse topics :) I presented your ’95 Biometrika paper there 3 years ago, and started to learn causal graphs, though I’m still a beginner! Overlap for CG is one topic motivated by that presentation.
