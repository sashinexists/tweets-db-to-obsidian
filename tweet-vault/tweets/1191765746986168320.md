@fledglingStat @robertstats @stephensenn @yudapearl Adjusting for vars that are associated w outcome but not exposure will decrease standard errors but wont change causal effect.

Also, remember not to adjust for any mediators if youre trying to estimate causal effect of x-&gt;y. if you do, the computer will give you the wrong answer
