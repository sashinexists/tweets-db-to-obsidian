@IntuitMachine @raulincze @dennybritz @Waymo Honestly, I am not sure any of the DL researchers grasps today what I was talking about then. Why? They are busy reaping the fruits of success. To understand the ladder one needs to  take the time and solve ONE toy problem from A to B, eg Mary's income had she not quit college.
