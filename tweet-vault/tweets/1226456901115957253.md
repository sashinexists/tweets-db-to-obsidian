@yudapearl Day #12 #studyingCausality p22-4 Causal Bayesian Network definition, when I tried to turn leaf 'slippery' node into active do(X=x) node without 'wet', all I could come up was adding 'Banana Peel' node &amp; turn it on, so adding new 'internal to leaf', but 'root w/o parents' top node https://t.co/Cb6SCF0Lpw
