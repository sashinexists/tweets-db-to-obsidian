@yudapearl @fuzzydunlop123 @autoregress @MariaGlymour @PHuenermund @EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer @metrics52 But there is a world of difference between, "I would find the paper easier to read with a DAG" and "Economists do things wrong because they can't solve toy problems." So I ask again -- what did the authors do wrong? How would their estimation strategy differ if they used DAGs?
