@edwardsjk @EpidByDesign @LauraBBalzer @eliasbareinboim @Megtron9 @Lizstuartdc @leskocar @_MiguelHernan @Carthica @herbps10 @LeontineAlkema @BreskinEpi @nondogmatist I take it that the idea is to "combine" observational and experimental studies, rather than exclude one in favor of the other. Are the results of "combining" different than those of "fusing"? As in eg https://t.co/E1ap1N4ZCh ?#Bookofwhy
