@richard_landes @DKedmey @DavidDeutschOxf @EinatWilf @sapinker @LRNR An important iota: Jews did not criticize received truths. They contradicted those truths by their mere normal existence; eating, sleeping, reproducing, singing, etc. "The Pattern" was designed to shake any semblance of normality. Very much like BDS anti-normalization obsession.
