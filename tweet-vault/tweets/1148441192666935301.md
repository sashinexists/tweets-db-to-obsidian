@yudapearl @autoregress @MariaGlymour @PHuenermund @EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer @metrics52 Does this mean economists shouldn't invest the time to learn DAGs and do-calculus? It depends. I think some would benefit from learning more about them. But stop pretending that the cases which are difficult to solve without DAGs arise in every case -- they surely do not.
