The famous plea: "Give me Yavne and its scholars" was made when Jerusalem was in flames. @PeterBeinhart distorts it to wet the appetite of Jerusalem's enemies, while she is a thriving center of art &amp; science, and a bastion of moral clarity. Beinart is a catalyst of destruction. https://t.co/oeB4rUwvFz
