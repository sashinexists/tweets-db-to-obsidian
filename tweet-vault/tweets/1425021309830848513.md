@BaskervilleJudy @FeechPeach @KevinKay500bee Indeed, the word "antisemitism" does not appear in the USC Letter. On purpose! To prevent the administration from taking refuge in the "antisemitism" debate. What is emphasized instead is (1) the criminalization of Israel's birth and (2) its effect on students.
