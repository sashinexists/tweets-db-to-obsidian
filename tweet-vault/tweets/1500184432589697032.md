@yudapearl @hemanth_kanak @ADAlthousePhD @PavlosMsaouel @GustafRydevik @stephensenn @f2harrell @SMuellerLab obviously Judea is asking about the literature on RCT methods, not the individual trial protocols...
can we find answers to the above questions in your book on drug development, @stephensenn ? 
would appreciate if you could point to chapter, section, pages, please!
