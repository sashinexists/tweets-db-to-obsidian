@makoyass @TomChivers To give an example of a complex evolutionary process whose end product is easily emulatable, take Pavlovian response. The dog's response to a bell can be mimicked by computing P(food|bell), In contrast, a child's empathy towards a stranger cannot be mimicked by such simple trick.
