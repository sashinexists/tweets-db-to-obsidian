@MariaGlymour @alex__morley @dan_marinazzo @yudapearl While I don't doubt that there is an SCM that leads to identical equations, it feels weird to me to argue about continuity and discontinuity in a big and complex system of which we only observe inputs and outputs in those terms. I would love to read a paper, though.
