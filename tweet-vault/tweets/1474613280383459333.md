@Ang_UCLA @yudapearl @smueller @stephensenn @RWJE_BA @PavlosMsaouel @f2harrell @ChristosArgyrop @AndrewPGrieve @HL327 Thx. I figured out. DAG assumptions for Z in SAP article, leading to identifiable stratum-specific effects, are assumed in Lemma 5 in Appendix of r488! It means strata effects can come from RCT or observations, if Z block all factors contributing to covariation of Tx and outcome.
