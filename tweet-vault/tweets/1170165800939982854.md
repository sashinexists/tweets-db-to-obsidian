@AdanZBecerra1 @yudapearl @PHuenermund @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal I don't think you understood my question. Can you send me the DAG you believe in for this question? What I want to know is, given your DAG, how would the raw data look different under different answers to the causal question you posed?
