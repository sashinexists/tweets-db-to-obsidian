I can identify the skinnerian level as a subset of Rung-1 (which embraces retrodiction.) and Popperian level as Rung-2 (love the emphasis on "models").
The other levels are not described in term of capabilities -- hard to place. And I dont find counterfactuals, strange.#Bookofwhy https://t.co/rJ0qtqK7xU
