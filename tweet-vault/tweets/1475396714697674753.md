@AustenCF @FreeformMethod You may have other Jewish features, but some anti-Zionist Jews are indeed "by birth only". So, go ahead, define yourself the way you want but, please, let Zionists define themselves as they want, separated from you, and do not say "As a Jew" because you are not speaking for them.
