@raj_mehta @stephensenn @smueller @miquelporta @f2harrell @suiss70 Note, Altman is treating NNT(benefit) and NNT(harm) separately, assuming monotonicity in each case. But he does not consider a population as being a mixture of two types of individuals, some "benefitting" and some "harmed". See Wikipedia: https://t.co/PjJhmuwRNV
