@yudapearl @eliasbareinboim @mendel_random Hmm, ok.. In the RL literature, I think the assumptions are very clearly stated for all the theoretical results and it seems to me that they are trivial to translate to causal graphs if that is one's sport. This seemed to be the case for the specific cases I looked at at least.
