@mribeirodantas @tdietterich @StanfordHAI 2/ there will be no one to hire for the job. Nadda. The enlightened executive will then say: Let's establish a "Data-Interpretation Center" at the University of xyz, and endow it with 0.01% of the resources now pouring into data-fitting centers. Get ready, it will happen soon.
