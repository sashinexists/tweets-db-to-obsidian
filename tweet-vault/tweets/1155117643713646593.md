@dlmillimet @paulgp @PEngzell @patrickaturley There's a recent paper that shows that the OLS coefficients are an average weighted by the variance-covariance of the individual treatment effects in this case. Should be applicable here as well, I would say (assuming an all-causes regression). https://t.co/Xo9Vurt4DO
