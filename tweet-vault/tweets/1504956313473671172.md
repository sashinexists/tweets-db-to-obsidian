@stephensenn @EngineerDiet @soboleffspaces @JFronczekMD @EpiEllie @f2harrell @ADAlthousePhD @artistexyz @statsepi @GuyattGH @GRADE_WG Let's not get hung up on whether the "ideal" is realizable. Our question is what RCT is aiming to estimate. "Aiming" defines the "ideal". If there is no aim, there is no direction and no sense of better or worse design. I can't wait to hear what the AIM is, one formula please.
