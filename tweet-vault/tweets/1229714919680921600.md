@richard_landes @DKedmey @DavidDeutschOxf @EinatWilf @sapinker @LRNR My point is that Jews were not actively "criticizing" revealed truths. "Debates" were forced upon them. What provoked hostility was not the persistence of their beliefs as much as the persistence of their biological existence; Wrong beliefs had to show up as abnormal existence.
