@steventberry @lewbel @causalinf @PHuenermund @econbookclub @Chris_Auld @analisereal @jdramirezc @PhilHaile I am asking because I find myself unable to answer many of the questions you are asking each other. Sometimes I hear that structure is defined in terms of counterfactuals, and sometimes the other way around. What comes first? I ask myself, and how should an econ student think?
