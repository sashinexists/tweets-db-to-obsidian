The question comes: How can we tell if an algorithm "uses" some causal model of the world? Ans. Run it in a different universe (or domain) and see if it acts differently.
So what about data-fitting? Change the universe keeping same sample distribution, will it act differently? https://t.co/FhaIzXhhxg
