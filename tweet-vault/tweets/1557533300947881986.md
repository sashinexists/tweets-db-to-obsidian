@yudapearl @juliajassey @JGreenblattADL So right Prof Pearl (I worked with your beloved son). But most these Jewish anti-Zionist activists have no interest in listening, or self-reflection. That @JFREJNYC's political arm endorsed a BDS supporter in the most Jewish district in the uS (#NY10) says it all.
