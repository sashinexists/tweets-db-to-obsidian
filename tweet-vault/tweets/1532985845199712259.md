@yudapearl @stefanharmeling Thanks professor. So may I think my proof in this specific sitution is reasonable? This is critical to me because I am a beginner in CI.
As to whether Rule 3 can be deduced from 1 and 2 in any case, it is still a question need to be proved or falsified.
Do I understand correctly? https://t.co/oOZSsqtGUs
