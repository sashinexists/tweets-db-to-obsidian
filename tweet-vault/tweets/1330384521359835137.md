@Blattberg @AndrewPessin @EinatWilf The most dangerous anti-Zionists today are the congressional Squad. Take Israel away, and they would love Jewish food and culture. They are not 'crazy,' but rather hateful, calculated and methodical, working compulsively towards the elimination of the world's greatest evil.
