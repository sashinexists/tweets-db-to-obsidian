@soboleffspaces @yudapearl @causalinf @nickchk Pa(X) —&gt; X is assumed a causal relation in a causal DAG. A hidden common cause would be Pa(X) &lt;- - -&gt; X. 

I don’t understand when you say an admissible set S can be defined at a purely associational level, could u explain?

Confounding is a causal and pair-specific (X,Y) issue.
