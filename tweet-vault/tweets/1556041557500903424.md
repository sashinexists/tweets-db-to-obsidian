@MeganTStevenson @PHuenermund @paulgp @dlmillimet @pietrobiroli @yudapearl @eliasbareinboim @josh_t_dean @uhlily But if I ran an RCT on a college admissions process &amp; found listing race as non-white on the application leads to a reduced chance of admissions you wouldnt say the admissions system is directly discriminating on race (as well, potentially, as indirectly on some race correlate)?
