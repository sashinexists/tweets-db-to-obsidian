@stephensenn @f2harrell @soboleffspaces @SMuellerLab I am trying to learn how RCT's are run with one object in mind -- to improve them. I don't understand how you can say that RCT's are outside the province of CI (the hammer) when they are all about cause and effect and, from what I can tell thus far, have not been formalized yet.
