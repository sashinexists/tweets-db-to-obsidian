@yudapearl @ConiByera @omaclaren @AndersHuitfeldt Just a visual cue. If the DAG including U is well-formulated, then I think I am happy. It gives me the early warning I need. I read it as Z modifies the relationship from X -&gt; Y, or X modifies the relationship Z -&gt; Y, through a process. Is that reading "legal"? https://t.co/ix4Ni5UPi7
