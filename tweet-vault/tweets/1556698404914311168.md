@EpiEllie @pietrobiroli @PHuenermund @instrumenthull @paulgp @dlmillimet @eliasbareinboim Wait a minute. How a quantity is estimated in "actual experimental study" is what determines its having or not having "real world analog"?
What's wrong then with the Mediation Formula for observational/experimental studies?
See https://t.co/1Q5AaScEEp for "real world" examples.
