@soboleffspaces @HL327 @yudapearl @ADAlthousePhD @artistexyz @JFronczekMD @EpiEllie @f2harrell @statsepi @GuyattGH @GRADE_WG Indeed. Although sometimes it is better to accept a difficult truth than go for an easy lie. Benefit is rarely binary and other assumptions are important and need to be carefully examined. The goal is to be useful in practice not perfect in theory.
