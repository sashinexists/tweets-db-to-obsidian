@harryrutter @SamueleMarcora @cavilln @AdrianBauman @fiona_bull @WHOBulletin ... I worry that everyone seems so convinced that total PA per se is well evidenced casually to improve health, longevity etc. Despite being a proponent of PA I think evidence is shaky at best. I'm concerned the focus on systems distracts from understanding that question.
