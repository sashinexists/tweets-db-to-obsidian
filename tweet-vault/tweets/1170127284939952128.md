@Jabaluck @yudapearl @PHuenermund @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal Yes good.that's one unequal race relation that u could evaluate. Differential treatment patterns by race.I like the way you stated it above because in my mind it points out why immediately drawing DAG after stating the question gives you a chance at causal inf. Otherwise no shot.
