@eliasbareinboim @yudapearl My argument doesn’t depend on G, as such. G just defines a particular structure on the indexing set, but is not needed for this definition. My arg applies to stat estimation, causal estimation and inverse problems etc. Your ‘causal model’ could be anything and it would still work
