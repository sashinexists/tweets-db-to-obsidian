@Jabaluck @yudapearl @autoregress @eliasbareinboim @juli_schuess @CarterPaddy This is the challenge teaching DAGs.  The rules of working with DAGs are easy, but the challenge is, "how do I turn my question into a DAG that I can work with?"  This is a non-trivial exercise that requires interaction between methodologists and subject matter experts.
