@yudapearl @autoregress @guilhermejd1 @analisereal @Chris_Auld @gelbach @HeerJeet Yes, so why should we always commit to a specific structural model if we don't know which model is right and we have made assumptions consistent with a class of such models that suffice to compute the counterfactuals of interest?
