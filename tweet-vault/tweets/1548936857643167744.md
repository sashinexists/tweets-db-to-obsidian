@soboleffspaces @IJCAIconf Interesting observation! Both trialists and ML folks try to avoid domain-knowledge, but the motivation is slightly different. Trialists fear "subjectivity bias", while ML fear the labor of elicitation. CI alleviates both fears by offering  friendly &amp; tractable knowledge models.
