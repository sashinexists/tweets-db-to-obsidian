@EpiEllie @yudapearl @NeuroStats @l__ds @ken_rothman Yes, that's the benefit for me, too; it helps me think more clearly about that. I'm not sure if that's because it's the way I was trained or because it can be difficult to convey interaction in a DAG (also, I never thought about what that  implies re: the scale of interaction ðŸ¤”)
