@djvanness So something like this? It clarifies that Z is an EM and not just a cause of Y, but you can ignore the gray arrow/box for the do-calculus. I'm curious if other people have amore elegant way of illustrating EM other than drawing the technically correct DAG w/ the EM box+arrow. https://t.co/DzpeMIkAqD
