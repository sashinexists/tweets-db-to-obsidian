@eliasbareinboim @yudapearl The strength of the signal is everything.  Most cancer studies can't really tell at the END of the study whether one treatment is better than the other on the AVERAGE.  To be able to know heterogeneity in real time in these studies is simply not possible if it's not poss. at end.
