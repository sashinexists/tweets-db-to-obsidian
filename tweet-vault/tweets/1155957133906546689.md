@Jabaluck @erinhengel @PHuenermund @yudapearl no...take X_1-&gt;X_2-&gt;X_3-&gt;X_4, plus (hard 2 draw) an edge from X_1 to X_4 that is very weak rel to the 3 chain edges. I want causal eff of X_2 on X_4, your logic implies that conditioning on X_3 helps, because it is highly corr with X_1, the confounder, but it's a terrible idea...
