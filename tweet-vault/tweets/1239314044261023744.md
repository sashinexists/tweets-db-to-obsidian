@tudorcodes @imleslahdin All data are generated by some causal processes, hence causal diagrams can always be used to capture the statistical features of the data, provided we allow for hidden variables (&amp; selection B). To save the labor of dealing with hiddens, you may use undirected graphs.  #Bookofwhy
