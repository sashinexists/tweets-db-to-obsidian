@Jabaluck @PHuenermund @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal This is how Phillip and Sewall Wright "stumbled upon" IV's, now a celebrated "research design". They started with 4-5 variables, causal relations among them, Sewall's trick of converting them to covariance constraints and faint hope of inverting them back, no "design". #Bookofwhy
