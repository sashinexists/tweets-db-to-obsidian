@questionsin2014 @ShaiDeLuca @marclamonthill @deliveries_i @ClaireRedacted @ShorrTirza @Donald191 @MJPlitnick Zionophobes, like chameleons, are masters of color adaptation. When seeking victimhood they are merely "critiquing the occupation", when seeking Israel's destruction they are merely studying the Western notion of a "State". Colorful creatures, Zionophobes.
