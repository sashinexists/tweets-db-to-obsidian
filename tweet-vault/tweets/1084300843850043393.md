@eliasbareinboim @omaclaren @yudapearl @PHuenermund You could measure the strength of the relationship between S and C. You might choose to believe it's a causal relationship or not on that basis. There'd be some shaky assumptions. Ideally you want a series of randomized-control trial where you demonstrate an effect repeatedly.
