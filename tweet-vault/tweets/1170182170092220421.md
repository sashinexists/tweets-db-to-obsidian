@AdanZBecerra1 @yudapearl @PHuenermund @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal I understand that. In this case, you didn't even try to estimate any causal effects so the points I was making aren't relevant. You assumed you knew the causal effect already -- this latter is a questionable assumption however.
