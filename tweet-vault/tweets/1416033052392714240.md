@YallaGaza @realRahulRK The more you talk the more I hear traditional Zionist ideas coming from your side: "peace &amp; security &amp; coexistence as EQUALS". Very encouraging. One missing ingredient is: "Equally indigenous". Can you pronounce that? Once you do, you will be elevated to "Zionist at heart"
