@jasonintrator @glogauer_jakob @TheIHRA A group HAS a self. What makes an individual have self is memory, telling him: your experience yesterday informs your decision today. Same with groups, except here the pertinent experience spans centuries, and will easily get lost unless members attain self-determination
