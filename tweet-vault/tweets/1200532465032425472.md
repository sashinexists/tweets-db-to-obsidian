@Lester_Domes @EpiEllie @ConiByera @LucyStats @AlexaYakubovich @AnjaLeist @rohitpojha @AbbyCScience @_MiguelHernan @casualinfer Great! No pathology. So we agree that it is OK to call the function  f(x,y) = P(Y=y| do(X=x)) "causal effect of X on Y", though in some extreme cases it may be independent on x. And despite the fact that some people may confuse it with the difference E(x=1, y)-E(x=0,y).#Bookofwhy
