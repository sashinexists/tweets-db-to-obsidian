@VC31415 @sbuhai @yudapearl @JaapAbbring @Chris_Auld @DonskerClass @PhilHaile @steventberry I agree with Victor here. Another rough distinction is that RFers generally seek identification vis randomization (or similar like parallel trends), structuralists more often exploit exclusions, functional form, or other model restrictions.
