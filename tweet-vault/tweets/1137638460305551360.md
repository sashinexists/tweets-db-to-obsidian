I do not understand expressions such as "be all and end all"; I have not used any, nor implied any. As to your question, the diagram on p217 already contains "Hall"; it coincides with "Diet", exactly as presented in Wainer etal. Nothing changed. Just causal modeling. #Bookofwhy https://t.co/o4k6kyeQxO
