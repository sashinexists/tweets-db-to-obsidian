@stephensenn @yudapearl @AndrewPGrieve @PavlosMsaouel @soboleffspaces @f2harrell @smueller @ChristosArgyrop Can you elaborate this? For me reprenativeness is crucial. The problem (IMO) is that maybe observational studies are more representatove in some cases (not in general!). But in this case many times the indication for trearment is unclear. This is another big problem of OS.
