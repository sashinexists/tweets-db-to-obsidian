@yudapearl @regev_nir @BernieSanders So your information is purely subjective. There's no objective information - such as quantitative or qualitative surveys of voter intentions or actions - which supports your hypothesis. 

How does your hypothesis rate, do you think, as a scientific explanation of voter behaviour?
