I wouldn't put it that bluntly. First, there two Humes: (1) Causation = Covariation and (2) Causation = Counterfactuals. Second, I object to Hume-1 (like everyone else). Third, I agree with Hume-2 but go further to ask "Where do counterfactuals come from? &amp; how are they stored?" https://t.co/0phbCPldnr
