@MariaGlymour @AdanZBecerra1 @_MiguelHernan @EpiEllie @ProfMattFox @yudapearl 1/2) Do you have any examples of DAGs showing study effects? In linear models these can be ignored because concurrent control is practised so that like is compared with like. However when leveraging historical control data they have to be allowed for in the model.
