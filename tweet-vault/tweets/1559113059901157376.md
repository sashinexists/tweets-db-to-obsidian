@MissDiagnosis is one of those Pakistani friends to whom I must apologize for being unable to celebrate Pakistani 75th birthday. https://t.co/iyH8DeZcON
@AsraNomani and Prof. @akbarahmed479 are likewise being asked to forgive me, together with the many journalists I got to know. https://t.co/A4eB6LHy62
