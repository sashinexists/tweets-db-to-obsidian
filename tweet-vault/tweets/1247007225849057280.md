@VincentAB @causalinf @dade_us @EpiEllie I agree of course with your conclusions. What I do not understand is your self-doubt. There is only one definition of IV and one way of verifying it. Only economists are confused today about IV's because, having vowed to shun graphs, they are still debating what "exogeneity" is.
