@yudapearl @rohitpojha @AbbyCScience @Lester_Domes @_MiguelHernan @casualinfer Your “target” is surely not a policy per se—it’s a decision about whether to implement a policy or not. You can easily imagine a trial that would allow you to estimate the causal effect of policy vs no policy. Therefore there is no conflict. A target trial can be used for policy.
