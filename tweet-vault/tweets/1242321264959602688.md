@AdanZBecerra1 @mayfer @_MiguelHernan In the case of CV, it is reasonable to assume:
"CV caused death" = "CV verified &amp; death." Counterfactual logic is needed when we doubt this identity.
Note that "verified" is still different from "tested positive"
which is behind the statistics we are getting.#Bookofwhy
