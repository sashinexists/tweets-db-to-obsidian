@stephensenn @PavlosMsaouel @ESteyerberg @LinkedIn @Lester_Domes @MariaGlymour @NP_Jewell @XiaoLiMeng1 In my understanding,  Lord's story does NOT have any design in it (especially in the Wainer and Brown version). The treatment (diet) varies between halls in the same way that the barometer reading varies with the atmospheric pressure. No "choice" involved.
