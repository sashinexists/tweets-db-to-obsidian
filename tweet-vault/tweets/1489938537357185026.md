@soboleffspaces @yudapearl @causalinf @nickchk @EpiEllie Question #2: sg an ‘analytical philosopher’ might ask: Lewis’ linguistics treatment seems to focus on counterfactuals dealing w/ tokens/individuals, but not w/ random variable X taking values from a distribution, cool to call it Pearl/Lewis but highlighting diff would make sense?
