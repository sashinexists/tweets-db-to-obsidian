@shravanvasishth @yudapearl @StatModeling @mcmc_stan (agreed): Scientists hold/test multiple competing mental models and regularly check their ideas against each other.  The search for causality in science is broader than any stat.'s "causal inference".  These tools have their uses but the pettiness is out of control.
