@intelligence2 @EWilf @bariweiss @SethAMandel @DanielBShapiro @ZionessMovement @yudapearl @WarpedMirrorPMB @LTCPeterLerner @HillelNeuer @BretStephensNYT @MsJulieLenarz @LahavHarkov Really hard to listen to Mehdi Hasan repeatedly use the word, “ahistorical” about those of us who call antiZionism antisemitic.
Desperately trying at every opportunity to erase the danger to Jews from BDS, antiZionists and the left.
