@BetsyOgburn @lihua_lei_stat @VC31415 @yudapearl @artistexyz @ShalitUri @CasualBrady does this work?

if X-&gt;T-&gt;Y, X-&gt;Y,  CATE(x) identified for x where the propensity score is bounded away from 0,1

you might have two weighted estimands E[w(X) CATE(X)]. If the support of the weights w(.) are different then they require different positivity assumptions
