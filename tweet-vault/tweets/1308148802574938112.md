@CasualBrady @analisereal Sure. How else is Y(t) defined? It is certainly not a property of probability distribution. So what is it? A new variable? So, how do we compute its value once we know everything about the world? Rubin &amp; Co. evade this question by appealing to intuition about RCT. half-cheating.
