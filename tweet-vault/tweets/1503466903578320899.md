@artistexyz @soboleffspaces @yudapearl @AndrewPGrieve @suiss70 @miquelporta @f2harrell We are equally interested in point estimate and uncertainty in effect (confidence interval, credible interval, or Bayesian probability). If confidence limits are wide, we will not mandate such an intervention in healthcare systems. Because ATE from RCTs is free from confounding.
