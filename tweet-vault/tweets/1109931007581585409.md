@analisereal @convexify @paulnovosad @btshapir @yudapearl @eliasbareinboim The question--to be clear--is not whether m-bias is a mistake conditional on a DAG (that is clear), but whether there are cases in practice where, given the specification of the model, there is m-bias econs ignored (or perhaps a persuasive case for a better model that has m-bias)
