@yudapearl @AdanZBecerra1 @WhitneyEpi @sherrirose @laura_tastic @PWGTennant @EpiEllie @AlexBroadbent @StatModeling @Lester_Domes @MaartenvSmeden @Lizstuartdc @JMichaelMcW @JohnRTMonsonMD You cannot escape multilevel reasoning in this way. If you ‘see’ that the way that experimental material varies is complex the way that you ‘do’ things to it affects your inferences. Deliberately varying things between clusters is not the same as varying them within.
