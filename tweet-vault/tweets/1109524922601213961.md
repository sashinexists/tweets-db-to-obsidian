@analisereal @convexify @paulnovosad @btshapir @yudapearl I liked this article: and I think it helps clarify the point I've been trying to make to you, @eliasbareinboim, and @yudapearl. My understanding is, with one-sided non-compliance, the front-door criterion is equivalent to comparing treated compliers with treated non-compliers.
