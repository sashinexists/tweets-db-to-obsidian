@jgradus @EpiEllie @ProfMattFox @BUSPHEpi As far as #bookofwhy is concerned, the purpose of Fig. 7.5 is to show: (1) that even toy problems can present a formidable challenge to the unaided mind (and PO). (2) Mt. Intervention is conquered, (3) science can be fun. Readers who internalized these 3 points need not solve 7.5
