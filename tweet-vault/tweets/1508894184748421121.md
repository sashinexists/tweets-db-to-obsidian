@gottfriedmath @yudapearl @nickchk @Lizstuartdc @PWGTennant DAG is a mathematical object. The definition of a "causal" graph must refer to math properties. If "causal" is external to the definition of causal DAG, then its analysis cannot prove causality of changes in one node by intervening in another.
