@thoughtfulflyer @davidhumeinst @PhilosophyMttrs True, I do follow the thinking of David Hume, with one added twist: True, counterfactuals are behind causation, and behind most scientific thoughts but, to my delight, they can also be algorithmitized. Thus, next generation robots will be mini-scientists. #Bookofwhy
