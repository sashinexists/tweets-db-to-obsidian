@dustinvtran @zacharylipton @eliasbareinboim @CsabaSzepesvari @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @ShalitUri I am not arguing, nor judging, just trying to appreciate what you do. Thanks for explaining, rather than sending me to "all the papers of XYZ". Given that you start with a model, do you compute an estimand before processing data? If not, what guidance is provided by the model?
