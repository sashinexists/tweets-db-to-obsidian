@loudquack @shravanvasishth @yudapearl But you agree that the phrase is true, right? Which makes this a valid critique of the statistical discipline, not an ad-hom. It follows that if your an statistician and feel attacked by this, either you are ignorant of the history of the field, or simply refuse to admit a truth.
