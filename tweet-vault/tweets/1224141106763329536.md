@jtrecenti @athos_damiani @agpatriota Why do you say "Causal models are useful" instead of "are necessary"?  "Useful" is what economists use to justify not using (see https://t.co/sZPpL7Ifmg). When we have same data demanding two different conclusions depending on the model, we say "necessary" #Bookofwhy
