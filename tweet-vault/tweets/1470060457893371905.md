@f2harrell @guyharvey70 @soboleffspaces @stephensenn @AndrewPGrieve @PavlosMsaouel If you are referring to https://t.co/lzxR8AR9QQ then, no, the RCT data were properly analyzed. The discrepancy with "real world data" is due to allowing men and women to decide, on their own, whether to take the drug. ie, it was not randomized.
