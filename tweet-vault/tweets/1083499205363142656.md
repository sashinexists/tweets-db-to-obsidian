@SueMarquezR @jim_savage_ @JimMinifie @Andrew___Baker @paulgp @jim_savage Thanks Sue, this is a thoughtful and precise paper on a deeper-level "structural economics" literature. However, it appears to me that anyone doing this deeper analysis should be able to do counterfactuals in structural equations. Yet the latter is oddly missing. #Bookofwhy
