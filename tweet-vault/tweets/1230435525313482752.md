@theromansandler @TMoldwin @TheBookOfWhy Glad you asked me, the least biased arbiter. The @Bookofwhy will equip you with elementary tools to solve elementary problems that even the most sophisticated theories in statistics, logic and NN cannot solve. It's "low-level" on the one hand and super "high-level" on the other.
