@Zio_conspirator @Claire_Voltaire @DeedsWylie The Bundists are not my tribe. What do we have in common? They deny Jewish peoplehood and Jewish history. The only commonality I can find: our grandmothers spoke Yiddish. The dust-bins of history are full of such EX-tribesmen. I have more in common with the Druze in Israel.
