@_JakeHumphries @EpiEllie @rohitpojha @AbbyCScience @Lester_Domes @_MiguelHernan @casualinfer I need analysis (and data) to estimate the probability that my headache will subside next half hour if I take aspirin. Note: I did not mention "trial". I will mention "trial" if I use RCT to interrogate nature. But I would never use "target trial" in the same breath. #Bookofwhy
