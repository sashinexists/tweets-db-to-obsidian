For ex, for an #AI to check backdoor paths it may need to actually erase arrows from X to Y in the DAG &amp; evaluate remaining arrow sequences. A person can just ignore those arrows. So a human-readable algorithm can exclude that step whereas an AI-readable algorithm might need it. https://t.co/7GbGLgBNtv
