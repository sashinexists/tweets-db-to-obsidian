@stephensenn @hmatejx @RWJE_BA We have universal languages to describe differences and similarities among experiment.
Am I right to assume that (1) is P(y|do(x)) and (2) is P(y|x) ????
The only way for me to find out if an assumption is reasonable is see evidence from researchers who understand the assumption.
