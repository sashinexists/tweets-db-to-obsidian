@lewbel @artistexyz @VC31415 @causalinf In your story it is the mental activity of "finding out about B" that caused A, not "B itself". To allow for mental causation, agent specific variables such as "intends" "desires" "knows that" etc. must be part of the model, in the form of multi-SEMs, one per agent.
