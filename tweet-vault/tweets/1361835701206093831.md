@Jabaluck @AdanZBecerra1 @dmckenzie001 @jenniferdoleac @PHuenermund @causalinf I have not seen such a well-defined problem yet, except those that causal logic tells me "you cant answer question Q given the information in model M". Do you really think that by repeating the phrase "you don't know" "You don't know" you are going to become convincing?
