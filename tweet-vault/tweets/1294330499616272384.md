@FJnyc @SheldonRanz @carlosthefridge @MaxRose4NY Happy to see the word Zionophobic used to settle disputes that no other word could. Yes, Zionophobia stands apart from antisemitism. The latter has some excuses (eg mental disorder, improper upbringing, etc), the former none. It's the ugliest word in town.
