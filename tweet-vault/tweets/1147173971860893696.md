@dkipb @AdamPalayew @yudapearl @causalinferenc @_MiguelHernan Isn’t it better for studies to be specific though? If I tell you “anything you do to reduce blood pressure, will on average have ok survival” that’s maybe fine as a first pass, but surely it’s better to know “doing X is the best option for reducing BP”?
