@learnfromerror @LucasJfriesen @stephensenn Just tell us what relations you wish to assign responsibility to, what data you have available and "mirror mirror on the wall" will tell you if it is doable or not, what else you need to complete the assignment, etc, etc. Articulate what you WANT to know, not what we dont know.
