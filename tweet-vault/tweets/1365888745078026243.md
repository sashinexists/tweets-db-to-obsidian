Purim, Tehran 2021 !! Amazing! 2,600 years after Queen Esther risked entering the King's court to plead for her people, her story is read in this court, not less risky. What's more amazing, I understand every word of it, and have not set foot in Tehran for at least 2,000 years. https://t.co/VDqYJ0Xwme
