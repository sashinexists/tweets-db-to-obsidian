@HL327 @stephensenn @soboleffspaces @yudapearl @ADAlthousePhD @JFronczekMD @EpiEllie @f2harrell @statsepi @GuyattGH @GRADE_WG I don't understand why ATE reflects negative feedback failure. If you look at the wiki. article for ATE, it never mentions any association with feedback. I've never heard of such an association before, in any books that I've read by Pearl, Economists,Epidemiologist. Origin? Refs?
