@yudapearl @ADAlthousePhD @f2harrell @soboleffspaces @SMuellerLab 2/2) Nothing in this process makes patients representative but it makes the two groups being compared comparable. Representative sampling can take place fom batches in process control or from voters on an electoral register but not in RCTs. Randomisation is not random sampling.
