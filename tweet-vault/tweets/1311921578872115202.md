I heard about do-calculus, I know what it is, and I still like your short video very much; highly recommended to all students of CI. I would only augment your course with a problem that cannot be solved without do-calculus, eg. the 'new napkin problem" on page 240 of #Bookofwhy. https://t.co/FupN7Da37B
