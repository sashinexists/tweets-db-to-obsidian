@f2harrell @EpiEllie @jwbelmon @acedens @cecilejanssens @venkmurthy @euanashley @PWGTennant This article was written 2008 and, yet, I see no sign of causal definition of "diagnosis". I wonder if probabilistic notions of diagnosis are still ruling the field? Or have they been replaced by Diagnosis = Best Explanation, as in  https://t.co/Sf5yw328zl ??#Bookofwhy
