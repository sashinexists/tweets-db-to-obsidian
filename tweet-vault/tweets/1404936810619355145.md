@DankMessiah1 @yudapearl @Randomaleph @JoshMandelOhio @AdamMilstein Amazing, simultaneously saying "this handful of radical Israelis don't speak for everyone" and then "oh look at how scary Hamas is, this is what all Palestinians believe"

If the psychotic violent settlers aren't representative of Israel, why is Hamas representative of Palestine?
