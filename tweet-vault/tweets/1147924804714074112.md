@f2harrell @yudapearl maybe i'm being too simplistic, but isn't a trained network matrix, whether a neural net, convnet, or random forest, a model consisting of the weights in the structure of the matrix? a directed graph is also then a model. or are you saying models can come only by human intellect?
