@soboleffspaces @causalinf @nickchk I am not sure I can agree with that, but willing to learn new interpretation. I'm under the impression that DAG relationships must be causal. Otherwise, if only conditional independencies, how would we be able to tell 
X---&gt;Y from Y---&gt;X ? Both convey same independencies.
