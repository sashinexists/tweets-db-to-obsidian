But in a causal DAG we usually only need vars that are common causes of 2+ nodes, so this U may feel weird.

@yudapearl &amp; @eliasbareinboim suggest “selection diagrams”. These work basically the same but instead of U have an indicator S &amp; the var it points to differs bt/wn pops. https://t.co/6GevGeqLWa
