@eliasbareinboim @statwonk @yudapearl @PHuenermund What I’m saying is that, interestingly, every HM I’ve seen is a fully specified generative model. So yes, it seems to be an issue that HM struggle with (but I don’t use them for data analysis, I use them along with fully specified physical models. Others might know more)
