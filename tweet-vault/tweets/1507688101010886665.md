Crazy to imagine how Hegel’s system, mostly the ‘what is actual is rational’ part of the Doppelsatz, has functioned 4 years (1831-34) as the official doctrine of the Prussian state, would not read a book on this but rather watch a movie where plot is written by Kafka &amp; Coen Bros https://t.co/BOxCeS4IQ1
