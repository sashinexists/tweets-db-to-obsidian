@soboleffspaces @dylanarmbruste3 @gottfriedmath @nickchk @Lizstuartdc @PWGTennant Yes. When I speak of RCT, I have in mind an "ideal" RCT, i.e., a study capable of estimating E(Y_1 - Y_0). Though I know, based on our conversations, that practicing trialists think differently. They do not have an estimand in mind; RCT is whatever an approved protocol delivers.
