My final Confucius proverb: What do we tell a statistician, an economist or a ML researcher who insists on doing model-blind learning? Confucius says: "It is only by understanding how models should be used when we have them that we can learn how to live without them!" #Bookofwhy https://t.co/tKkOEWSOrk
