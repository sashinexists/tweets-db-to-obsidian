@raymondshpeley @eliasbareinboim @autoregress @yudapearl @CarterPaddy This raises the question: are the cases where DAGs are more tractable of real-world interest? Are their applications where proper consideration of these cases is actually the best available empirical strategy? Answering this challenge requires real world examples.
