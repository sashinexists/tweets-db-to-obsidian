@Blattberg @anniefofani @AndrewPessin @EinatWilf The political community in the US names streets and schools after G. Washington and MLK, not Napoleon or Chez Guevara and, in this way, it gathers more and more common memories, to slowly and organically become a national community. Not to exclude, but to unite.
