@yudapearl @splcenter @ADL The quote above mentions Nation of Islam as a group they do list, and the same FAQ also says this (below)

I can't see how they are "legitimizing some hate groups" based on this, or the logic of how--even if that were true--it would imply that they don't fight any hate groups https://t.co/QSM5JmuTde
