@ConiByera @yudapearl @AlexaYakubovich @AnjaLeist @rohitpojha @EpiEllie @AbbyCScience @Lester_Domes @_MiguelHernan @casualinfer Hmm this may be semantics again, but in that case Iâ€™m interpreting that E[Y(X=0)] would be like the average tide given the moon being in a specific position, like E[ðŸŒŠ(ðŸŒ’)] or E[ðŸŒŠ(ðŸŒ”)] which alone doesnâ€™t describe a causal effect?
