@yudapearl @l__ds @malco_barrett @NeuroStats @ken_rothman Any component causes (say, A &amp; B) which occur together in at least one causal pie interact. Whether this is super- or sub-additivity will depend on the prevalence of all the other component causes that also occur in sufficient causes with either A or B or both.
