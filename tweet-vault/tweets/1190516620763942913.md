@Abel_TorresM @dmonett @boredyannlecun @ylecun I do not think it is correct without explicating what we mean by "based on correlation". If it means "based ONLY on correlation" I would say: No. If it means "based on correlation and causal assumptions" I would say: Sure, this is what #Bookofwhy is all about.
