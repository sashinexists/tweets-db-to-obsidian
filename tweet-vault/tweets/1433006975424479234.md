Would love to hear how you "focus on finding/implementing randomizations", namely,  how you "find randomizations" w/o a causal model in your head. Also, how/why you find reasoning with the model in your head to be harder than with something which is not in your head, but "clean". https://t.co/TQl0hM8qgC
