@parijat_267 @daniel_serman That's an interesting take which, as a scientist, I would entertain only after trying my best to refute, hoping to capture formally at least most features of "fairness" that we sapiens all share. Recall, the "no universal" excuse was tried on "beliefs", then on "causes".
