@yudapearl @GiulioGrossi @aleixrvr @causalinf I agree. SCM carries extra functional information that bnets don't carry, but 
1. PO doesn't carry that functional information either
2. The use of that functional info is to get point statistics. You can get point statistics from a prob distribution using MAP and ML estimators
