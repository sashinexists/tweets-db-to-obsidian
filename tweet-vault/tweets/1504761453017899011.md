@Jon_Williamson_ @federicarusso @soboleffspaces @dylanarmbruste3 @causalinf Frankly, I see no indication that any of the discussants in "The Reasoner" is familiar with SCM or even with #Bookofwhy. Not b/c they don't cite it, but b/c they express helplessness asking questions that have long been answered in SCM, including evidential pluralism.
