@PavlosMsaouel @AndersHuitfeldt @AndrewPGrieve @suiss70 @miquelporta My My, I felt right away that this terminology comes from a foreign source - authors who never used the do-operator, perhaps not even a causal  model. I think our paper gives more compelling reasons why P(benefit) should be of concern to both policy makers and individuals.
