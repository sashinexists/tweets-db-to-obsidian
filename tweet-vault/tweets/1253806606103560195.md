@analisereal @Jabaluck @autoregress @yudapearl @PACESconsulting @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @HeerJeet Well, I wouldn't say only transparent.. If folks doing the work cannot even CONTEMPLATE models that deviate slightly from the pre-canned ones, this seems to suggest that IV  &amp; the backdoor can faithfully represent ALL possible data collections in the world... Is this believable?!
