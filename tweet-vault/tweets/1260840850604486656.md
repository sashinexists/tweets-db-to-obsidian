Friday, 4 pm, May 14, 1948, Israel declared independence. Wild dancing in the hearts, not in the streets; a day earlier Gush Ezion surrenders to the Arab Legion and 127 defenders executed; a day later we (12 yr olds) found ourselves bombed by Egyptian war planes. What a miracle! https://t.co/SNQL0k19ph
