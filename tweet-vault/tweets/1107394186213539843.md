@Jabaluck @autoregress @yudapearl @CarterPaddy Maybe some economists can learn something about causal inference from computer scientists, it's possible. I doubt you can since you seem so proficient and knowledgeable about so many topics. It's certainly a great honor to find a polymath in our generation.
