I am surprised @doctorow takes "underspecification" to be the "wrecking ball" of ML. To me, the paper shows how difficult it is for ML folks to diagnose faults in a language that suggests their remedies, perhaps suspecting that any such remedy entails a ground-up reframing of ML. https://t.co/mZdElhKPam
