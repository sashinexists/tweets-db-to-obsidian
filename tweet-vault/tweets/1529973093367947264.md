@TheAcsMan @ShimonLevit @yudapearl @CNN Fair enough, if your opinion is based on their reporting in other areas that you know well and they are objective but not on Middle East.
I am questioning their investigation process. If they are not objective in one area, I would not anticipate them to be objective in others.
