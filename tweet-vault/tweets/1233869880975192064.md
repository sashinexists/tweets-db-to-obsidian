@tmorris_mrc @y2silence we can read text after text of scientific explanations of  biological phenomena - what leads to what, what prevents what etc etc - with not a single mention of RCT. See eg the Appendix to  https://t.co/en7vjmpuJR. RCT is a tool for interrogating, not explaining nature. #Bookofwhy
