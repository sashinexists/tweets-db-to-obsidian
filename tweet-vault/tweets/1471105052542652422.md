@yudapearl @JasonConnorPhD @AndrewPGrieve @jd_wilko @f2harrell @soboleffspaces I assumed that in the experimental study the values of 0.28 are NOT the observed rates but the differences. For example, it could be that 70% of the men in the drug group survived but only 42% in the control group. Or perhaps 75% versus 47%. Is this right?
