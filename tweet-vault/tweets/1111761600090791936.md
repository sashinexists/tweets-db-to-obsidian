@causalinf @rdahis @Jabaluck I am glad @causlinf is undertaking the task of summarizing this conversation. If I writes it, I would be accused of trying to sell "MY approach". Plus I am still a firm believer in the Axiom of Choice: "Solving one problem in DAGs is worth 100 debates ABOUT dags." #Bookofwhy
