Greatly astonished, I see with amazement that the paper I've recommended:  https://t.co/3OwoJrNmkj, has been cited ZERO times. I assume it's the title that turned people away "Graphoids over Counterfactuals". Today I would label it "Inference with Potential Outcomes". A beauty! https://t.co/6RA8RD1wpT
