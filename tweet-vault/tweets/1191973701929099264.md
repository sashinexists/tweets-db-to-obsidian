@stephensenn @autoregress @AdanZBecerra1 @fledglingStat @robertstats I thought you will give us a statistical criterion to decide which variables should safely be controlled for, to reduce SE. Hundreds of statisticians on this education channel will sigh in relief when you agree that no such criterion exists. #Bookofwhy
