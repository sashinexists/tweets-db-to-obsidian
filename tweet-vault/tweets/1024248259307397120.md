@EpiEllie @_MiguelHernan *The operator do(x) does tell us everything there is to know about an intervention.
The do-operator in itself does not restrict us in any way.  Those who wish to restrict themselves to "real" interventions would be thus restricted regardless of how they
formulate an intervention.
