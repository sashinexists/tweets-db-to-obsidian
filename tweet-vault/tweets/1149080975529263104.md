@Jabaluck @yskout @fuzzydunlop123 @autoregress @PHuenermund @pablogerbas @juli_schuess @MariaGlymour @EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer @metrics52 @eliasbareinboim 4/4 affect treatment, not outcome. So, it is hardly the case that "The language economists use seems efficient and unambiguous here." The language is ridden with ambiguities, which calls into question the credibility of key judgments issued by DAG-avoiding economists. #Bookofwhy
