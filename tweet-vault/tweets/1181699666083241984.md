the #math book I was waiting 4 &amp; how concept of curvature should be introduced quickly, bought it 4 ~20 GBP @ @heffersbookshop, will study it pseudo-religiously on a daily basis or as a humanist scholar but will benefit from it as the scientist/biologist I am :) thx @wtgowers&amp;co https://t.co/D0heDC2nZU
