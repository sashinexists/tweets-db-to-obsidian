Happy Birthday Israel! Sharing @EinatWilf pride and gratitude for having been born into a generation of Jews who knew their place, their country, and have earned their own defense when I was 11 years old. An unending dream #YomHaatzmaut #IndependenceDay.  I am also grateful 1/ https://t.co/Ag56dROTZ2
