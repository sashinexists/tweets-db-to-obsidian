@PHuenermund @dlmillimet @snavarrol @yudapearl @a40ruhr @causalinf @PossebomVitor @nickchk it's very rare to have two papers that have precisely the same DAG. What more often happens is that evidence from past literatures, with a different model, suggests by analogy how we should feel about some mechanism. Better than nothing, but an easy way to fool yourself.
