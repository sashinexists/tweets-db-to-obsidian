@WvanAmsterdam @stephensenn @f2harrell @soboleffspaces Nice, but we conduct RCT to find causal effects on some target population. Someone must take the RCT findings and generalize them to the target population. Now, why shouldn't the "generalized RCT" be applicable to those participating in the observational study?
