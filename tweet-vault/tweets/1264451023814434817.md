@yudapearl @beyers_louw Hi Judea â€“ What we suggest is that if you estimate P(Y|do(X)) via backdoor adjustment in a parametric regression, then it's best not to report the full regression table (as it's reported by popular software packages), but to omit the coefficients for the adjustment variables.
