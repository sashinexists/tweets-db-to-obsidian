@autoregress @yudapearl @PACESconsulting @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @Jabaluck @HeerJeet @eliasbareinboim I'm not sure I understand the difference you want to draw there, but to be more precise, what the algorithm gives us is a demarcation of what is possible and what is not possible without any functional constraints or distributional assumptions of the error terms whatsoever.
