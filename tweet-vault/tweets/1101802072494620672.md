@wgrosso @shakir_za @blei_lab @fhuszar Thanks for noting that the expression "waiting for their posteriors to peak" may be given grotesque interpretation, with "posteriors" being the rear parts of one's body, rather than "posterior probabilities continuously updated by data." Begging Bayesians for forgiveness.
