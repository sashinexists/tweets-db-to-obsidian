@Kangaskhan6 @yudapearl @SlezakPeter @btselem @hrw Israel, although far from perfect, is what it is now, due to hard work, perseverance and the love of your own rather than destruction of others. I wonder what the Palestinian movement would be now with such an attitude. Victimhood is not empowering.
