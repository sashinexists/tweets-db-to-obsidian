Most scientists think that anthropomorphic analogies are non-scientific, a mistake which explains why the question "what's a cause" got stuck in circular traps, and why science has not given us a language for causation. "Listening" has given it to us, together with logic &amp; tools. https://t.co/h5qP7qqEqQ
