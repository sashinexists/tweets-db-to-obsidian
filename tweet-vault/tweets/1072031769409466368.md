@yudapearl @GaryMarcus @tdietterich @ylecun Wait, that isn't necessarily so. GANs generate original output that wasn't "stored".

Just because *you* think you are manipulating symbols doesn't mean you aren't really just a (VERY) well-trained GAN that can convince all of us that you are reasoning...
