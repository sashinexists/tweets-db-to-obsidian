@LucyStats @AlexaYakubovich @AnjaLeist @rohitpojha @EpiEllie @AbbyCScience @Lester_Domes @_MiguelHernan @casualinfer I can't believe this is the official position of TT. Are you saying E[Y(X=0)] and E[Y(X=1)] may not be causal, and the difference E[Y(X=0)] - E[Y(X=1)] is causal just because we have a comparison? We need a top TT expert to confirm. You see why I am less than enthused? #Bookofwhy
