@Blattberg @davidmanheim @AndrewPessin @EinatWilf Surely they were not atheists, no one was atheist then, everyone had a God of some sort. The question is what was that God a symbol of. In the Jewish tradition, God's role in shaping a people's history is central, more so than, say, His role in managing weather or the afterlife.
