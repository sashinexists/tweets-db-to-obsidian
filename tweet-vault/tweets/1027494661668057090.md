@OstlundOllie @AndersHuitfeldt To rule out interpretations based on selection bias, let us assume that the 200 students were randomly selected;  not "volunteers". Let us also assume that students did not know whether they are in the randomized group or in the free choice group. Let's keep it simple. #Bookofwhy
