@lihua_lei_stat @ShalitUri @VC31415 @CasualBrady Apologize for asking, but I could not contain my surprise. Usually, when I speak to Stanford folks, I have to assume zero common understanding, and a curtain over the communication. Why don't you offer @drfeifei to teach a course in CI? Or renovate Koller's class in Graphical M?
