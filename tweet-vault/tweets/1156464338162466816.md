@GRich_Cinci @Ben_C_J @NicoleBarbaro Very interesting paper. Published in 2019; 25 years after causal language has been mathematized and separated  from statistical language! The author seems unaware of the causal revolution. No wonder! Has Psychometrika ever published an article on modern causal modeling?#Bookofwhy
