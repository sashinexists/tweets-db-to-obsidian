@ArabsForBernie @JGreenblattADL It's 2022 indeed, and nothing can justify the current treatment of Israel by Palestinian and their allies:(1) Denying Israel's legitimacy, as Putin denies Ukraine's, (2)  Launching rockets indiscriminately into civilian populations, as Putin+ Hamas are doing. Nothing can justify!
