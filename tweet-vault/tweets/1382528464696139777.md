My humble offering to Israel, on her 73rd birthday. 
             Mirdaf (The Chase)
             by Yaron London
"A land whose long history reads chase after chase,
Two thousand pages plus one,...
Yes, she is fearful, but as if not concerned,
Will wait for the end of the chase" https://t.co/AO3S2pvCb7
