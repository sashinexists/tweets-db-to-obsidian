@BetsyOgburn @VC31415 @yudapearl @artistexyz @ShalitUri @CasualBrady To be clear, the graph I considered (T-&gt;M-&gt;Y, X-&gt;T, X-&gt;Y) encodes a superset. If P(t|x)&gt;0, it’s true that IPW and outcome reg. both identify P(y|do(t)). The point is, if this overlap doesn’t hold, but the overlap for front-door holds (see below), P(y|do(t)) is still identifiable.
