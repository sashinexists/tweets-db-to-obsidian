@yudapearl @ildiazm @_MiguelHernan @deaneckles This doesn’t seem *that* far from a statistician saying they construct a physically meaningful non-statistical model of the world before using statistical methods to estimate the parameters. Eg Gelman’s example of combining a compartment ODE model with Bayesian inference. Or no?
