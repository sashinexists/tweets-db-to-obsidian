@yudapearl @steventberry @Jabaluck @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @MariaGlymour @autoregress All MHE methods, &amp; potential outcome notation, implicitly assume that a reduced form, as traditionally defined, exists. Those methods therefore assume away any underlying structural model that doesnâ€™t have a reduced form, like games with multiple equilibria.
