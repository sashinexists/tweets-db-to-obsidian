@totteh @yudapearl @rabois Not that randomization's only tool to guard against confounders. (But surely Pearl of all people didn't say that.) Can use multivariate modeling based on retrospective data. And certainly big data help with that. But still odd to say that big n per se replaces randomization. 2/2
