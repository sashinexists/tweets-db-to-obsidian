@peder_isager @HolgerSteinmetz @dingding_peng @fdabl @yudapearl hmm. in your example age seems like a proxy for a bunch of complex developmental/biological processes.

perhaps this is usually the case? age is easy to measure but in most cases it's a (reasonably good) proxy for a more complex developmental process
