@frankdevocht @cheryl_mcquire @petercraig200 @vkatikireddi @NIHRSPHR @_MiguelHernan @yudapearl Really nice paper. Obviously I am a big natural experiment "fan" but I am less sure about seeing them as distinct. Potential outcomes (or if you like DAG framework) provide a unifying framework already? Placing all study designs in these frameworks better?
