@BreskinEpi @eliasbareinboim @EpiEllie @l__ds @malco_barrett @NeuroStats @ken_rothman Eager to hear what the restrictions are: Number of pies? content of pies?
2-SAT? Horn restriction? Moreover, given a restricted PIE, does it let you "visualize" things like synergism or interactions, or send you back to sweat over the various pies in the system? #Bookofwhy
