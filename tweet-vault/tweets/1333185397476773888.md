@yudapearl @steventberry @lewbel @causalinf @PHuenermund @econbookclub @Chris_Auld @analisereal @jdramirezc There is much confusion for sure. But causality is defined by a counterfactual within a model (a structure or set of structures, a DAG = 1 example) allowing one to pose the question. Thus, structure can allow one to identify a counterfactual, as @steventberry suggests.
