@CsabaSzepesvari @AIforHI @dustinvtran @eliasbareinboim @zacharylipton @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @ShalitUri I think we are heading here towards some mutual understanding. Can you exemplify the engineering problem in which "we know how actions are generated"?? Just describe the setup in which "we know" and, then, what we can conclude from this knowledge, and what the final result is.
