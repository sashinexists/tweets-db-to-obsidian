Thanks for the raving review -  it made me take another look at the table of content and conclude, embarrassedly, that you have a point; the book casts a new light on many topics, including the traditional ones, like Bayes Rule, regression, RCT, IV. Funny! I enjoy reading it. https://t.co/YNkPwTSLei
