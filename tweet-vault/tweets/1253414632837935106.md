@autoregress @yudapearl @guilhermejd1 @analisereal @Chris_Auld @Jabaluck @gelbach @HeerJeet In the axiomatization of Halpern (https://t.co/ff2fQuX2MW), I think the formal statement is that any set of PO statement maps into an equivalence class of structural causal models. 

So every ignorability statement is not just one, but a class, of causal models.
