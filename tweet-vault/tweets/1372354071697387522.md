You don't need evangelists when math and commonsense are on your side. I am just a lens grinder, like Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677); once people open their eyes in a well lighted room, all they need is good eyeglasses, and an occasional lens grinder, when things get really foggy. https://t.co/i0SqRbqmQg
