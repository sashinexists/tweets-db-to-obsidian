@yudapearl @eddericu @zshahn @_MiguelHernan So to clarify what your notation means, do(x) is rung 2 intervention and actually *does* imply a well-defined (ie physically possible) intervention on x (despite our convo this summer), &amp; y(x) is any counterfactual under x regardless of whether x can be intervened on &amp; is rung 3?
