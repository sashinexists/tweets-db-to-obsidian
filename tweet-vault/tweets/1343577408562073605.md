Correct! The answer is NOT in the data, nor do we have the theory to answer it. But we have a logic of counterfactuals that tells us what kind of theory is needed to answer our questions, and what kind of data is needed to support that theory. My question: Who enforces the logic? https://t.co/PjBITL1fpL
