In Lord's (1967) paradox, one constraint in his own plot is, cov(S, WI)=cov(S, WF), where WI &amp; WF are two repeated weights. To embrace it in his DAG, @yudapearl had to claim that i) S-&gt;WI (a) equals the sum of ii) S-&gt;WI-&gt;WF (ac) &amp; iii) S-&gt;WF (b): a=ac+b. Not super satisfying 2 me https://t.co/hjhRmOeJBm
