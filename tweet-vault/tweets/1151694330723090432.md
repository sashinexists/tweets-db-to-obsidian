@djvanness @ConiByera @omaclaren @AndersHuitfeldt If your target quantity is P(Y|do(x),z) for different z's, you can identify it by controlling for C. The DAG with U gives you the same information, ie "interaction is possible". You probably want an early warning saying: "dont bother, no interaction here". Right? #Bookofwhy
