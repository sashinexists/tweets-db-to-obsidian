@autoregress @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @Jabaluck @HeerJeet Now, Wermuth and Cox are not DAG fanatics. They posed this problem b/c it came up in their investigation of sequential treatments. They wrote 3 articles on this problem, which involves only 5 variables. What does it tell us about economists and their "real world" arguments?
