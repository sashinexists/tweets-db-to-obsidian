@yudapearl @ConiByera @omaclaren @AndersHuitfeldt I think I see it now. The DAG represents causality only; it does not tell us any short cuts to obtain policy estimates for different levels of Z (which we could obtain if we knew the true functional relationship U(X,Z)). So, the structural information is a separate issue.
