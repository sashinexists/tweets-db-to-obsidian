@jad_kabbara @SlezakPeter @btselem @hrw This is indeed the key difference. Yes, there is hate in the fringe of Israeli society, condemned on every tv channel that you watch. In comparison, not ONE, I repeat not ONE Palestinian leader, teacher, cleric, tv-anchor would dare utter the words "Equally indigenous". Can you?
