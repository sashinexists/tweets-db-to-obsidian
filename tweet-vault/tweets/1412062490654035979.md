@yudapearl @Ilhan Iâ€™m pretty sure you made that word upðŸ¤£. The way I see it there are 3 options. Single state, 2 state, or ethnic cleansing. Single state wonâ€™t be a jewish state, 2 would allow for it, but settlers are a problem. Weâ€™re on the ethnic cleansing path with lots of moral self-licensing.
