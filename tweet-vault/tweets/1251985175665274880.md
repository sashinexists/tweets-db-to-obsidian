@danilobzdok @shakir_za @MaartenvSmeden @f2harrell @seanjtaylor Agree. It's an excellent Sunday read. But the message of this paper  https://t.co/GpSKmVcKR7 was "a reminder of how easy it is to fall into a web of paradoxical conclusions when relying solely on intuition, OR solely on statistics". We must snap out of statistics to get it right.
