@stephensenn @soboleffspaces @JFronczekMD @EpiEllie @f2harrell @ADAlthousePhD @artistexyz @statsepi @GuyattGH @GRADE_WG To eliminate any "baffling," please interpret everything I said or say about RCT to be about "ideal RCT", no imperfections, aiming to deliver an estimate of "Average Treatment Effect" (ATE) on some population of interest. I truly hope this clears away any baffling in the future.
