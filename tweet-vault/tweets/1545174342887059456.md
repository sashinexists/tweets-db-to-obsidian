@ProfLaurenRoss @KordingLab @shansiddiqi I am still trying to understand what people want when they crave for "definition of cause". If they crave for a trick to help them think when they construct a model, then I have a good one: "who listens to whom?". If they seek reduction to probability, we know it's impossible.
