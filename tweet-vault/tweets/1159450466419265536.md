@georgemsavva @stephensenn @statsepi But if Hall is perfectly correlated with Diet, why won't the effect of Diet on Gain not be the same as the effect of Hall on Gain. Once we decide what effect we need, the diagram delivers it for you, since we do not have unobserved confounders in the model. #Bookofwhy
