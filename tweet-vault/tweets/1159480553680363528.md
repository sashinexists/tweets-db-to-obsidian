@Jacobb_Douglas @yudapearl @PHuenermund @MariaGlymour @autoregress My view is that DAGs are helpful for certain kinds of questions like perhaps "mediation" that economists rarely think about in a formal way. And conceps like m-bias or front-door might have applications, but that has yet to be shown. (6/6)
