@abritishjourno @Ilhan OOPPS! Too late. You're right! The public is beginning to question the credibility of the old slogans: "cleansing" "apartheid" "colonialism", and NYT columnists need fresh new accusations to keep readers angry; none can top Uganda airspace; it's racist &amp; imperialist -- perfect.
