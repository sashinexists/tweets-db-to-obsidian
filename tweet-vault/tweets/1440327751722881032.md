@RaniaKassi @gilled34 @EinatWilf @newzionists I'll end this semi-civilized conversation by pointing out what it shows. Experts tell us the ME conflict is "highly complex". It is so very simple: One side says "we we we" the other says "me me me!". One says: "Equally indigenous", the other says: "Savage, colonialist, racist".
