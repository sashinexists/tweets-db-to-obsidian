@mendel_random @JohannesTextor @MariaGlymour @yudapearl Yeah...it's sounds like arguing that IV will replace trials, except rolling dice is fairly easy, while waiting for nature to do it for you is hard. So when you find an IV, you milk the hell out of it, as you should...but they are still unicorns.
