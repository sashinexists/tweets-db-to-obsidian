@MariaGlymour @yudapearl @PHuenermund @EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer @autoregress My contention is that researchers who operate by "closing back door paths" are implicitly making assumptions about the sources of variation in their X variable which are similar to IV, except usually, they are presuming implausibly that an (often unobserved) IV has an R^2 of 1.
