@totteh @WvanAmsterdam @stephensenn @f2harrell @soboleffspaces Sure. The PNS bounds are expressed in terms of
P(Y_x) and P(Y_x') , not P(Y_x|S) and P(Y_x'|S), assuming that some smart trialist managed to infer the former from the latter (after reading
CI papers). After all, who is interested in effects on the idiosyncratic selected (S).
