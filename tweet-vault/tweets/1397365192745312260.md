@defundtheparty @hallaq_ra I like this metaphor: " like ore in the search for a vein of evil." Israelis are searching tirelessly for the ore that is not committed to the destruction of Israel. Even your friend @hallaq_ra just tweeted: "And when I say a free Palestine I mean from the river to the sea."
