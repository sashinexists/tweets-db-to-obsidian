@steventberry @Jabaluck @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @yudapearl @MariaGlymour @autoregress Pushing this further, what is the need for the word structure and model, or using structural as an adjetive to model? Reading these slides I feel like structure is sometimes used as a synonym with model and sometimes we get ‘structural model’, but can’t we further simplify?
