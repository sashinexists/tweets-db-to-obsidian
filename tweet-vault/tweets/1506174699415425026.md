@DrRJCarter @mounirshita I would phrase it a bit differently. It's not the do-operator that takes you from Rung-1 to Rung-2, but the information encoded in the graph, parsimoniously, which allow the do-operators to produce (together with data) the consequences of every action or combination of actions.
