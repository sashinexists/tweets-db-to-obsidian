@DrewLevy @ESMDcan123 @PavlosMsaouel Wondering: How many regression analysts would agree with this statement: "A well-formulated regression model ultimately tells a causal story " which, based on my readings, would render most regression models "NOT well-formulated", since they have been denied any causal reading.
