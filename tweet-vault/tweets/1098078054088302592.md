@maqartan @aecoppock @SonjaASwanson @_MiguelHernan @graemedblair @jasperjcooper Check if I got it right. In ordinary IV setup we estimate the ATE among the compliers which are unidentified. In the new IV setup we estimate the ATE in another unidentified subpopulation which are not the compliers but psuedo-compliers. Am I right? But who are they?#Bookofwhy
