@sbuhai @yudapearl @JaapAbbring @Chris_Auld @DonskerClass @lewbel @PhilHaile @steventberry You see an euphemism where there is none.😀 If the department says “let’s hire someone in structural IO”, it is pretty clear what this means to everyone.  And surely I don’t meant to put down “non-structural” causal work (most of my own research work falls in this bucket).
