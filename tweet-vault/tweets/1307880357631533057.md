@Rezbab @Claire_Voltaire No. Racism has a broader sense than just "discrimination based on race". Today it is defined as "discrimination by any identity-based quality". For example, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, etc. Zionism is central to Jewish identity, not religion. (For most Jews).
