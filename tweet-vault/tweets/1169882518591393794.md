@Jabaluck @PHuenermund @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal You have very low opinion of experimentalists, assuming they are incapable of generalizing from  a toy problem to patterns of impediments they see in their substantive works. #Bookofwhy is written for enlightened experimentalists who, once aware, will dismantle those impediments.
