@ylecun @bschoelkopf I see dozens of "Data Science Institutes" erected across the country, I read their manifestos and I check their advisory boards. Causality does not seem to be on their agenda. Which makes one doubt whether the Ladder has been internalized and where this hype will end. #Bookofwhy
