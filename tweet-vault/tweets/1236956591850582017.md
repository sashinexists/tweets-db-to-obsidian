@Stebbing_Heuer @kurtosis0 @BernieSanders You got it perfect. Being Jewish is not genetic, nor religious, nor being a victim of the holocaust. It is identifying yourself with the history and destiny of a collective calling itself Jewish. Anyone can acquire it. E.g., Large segment of former Soviet citizens now in Israel.
