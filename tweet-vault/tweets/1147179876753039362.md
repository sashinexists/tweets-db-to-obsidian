@yudapearl @EpiEllie @causalinferenc @_MiguelHernan What is the summary causal effect of obesity on cancer? That's clearly got MANY problems as a question. I think it does fail 'identification', but then so does everything ever in my option.

Does the summary value have utility? Maybe? But I wish it was viewed MUCH more cautiously
