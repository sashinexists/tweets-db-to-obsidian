@Jabaluck @maximananyev @yudapearl Do you count the equivalence of PO and SEM as a contribution?

I think that holds great promise for teaching, b/c you could teach traditional SEM in metrics, introduce the do operator and show how PO drops out, and then say that PO can be used to summarize lots of SEMs.
