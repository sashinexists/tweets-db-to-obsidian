@yudapearl @causalinf @nickchk I start w/ a dependency graph. Arrows show dependency btw nodes: the value of terminus node depends on the value of origin node. They represent direct influence w/out reference to underlying mechanism. Being nonparametric or informed by SEM does not affect the graph topology.
