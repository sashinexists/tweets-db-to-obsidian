Disciplines that aspired to "find causal relationships" never made much progress. They should have first asked: "Suppose we have the causal relationships (ie, a model) what can we do with it?" And then: "What should the world be like to assure that we do the right thing?" 1/2 https://t.co/FyWwWJNafe
