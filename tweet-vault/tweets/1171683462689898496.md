It's 12 midnight, September 11, in LA, an hour I can't forget, b/c my son was murdered by the same people who made this day unforgettable. I salute the people of Israel who remember my fellow Americans through these columns of lights in the "9/11 Living Memorial", in Jerusalem. https://t.co/mBXSSlW5yw
