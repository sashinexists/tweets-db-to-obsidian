@ESteyerberg @stephensenn @LinkedIn @Lester_Domes @MariaGlymour @NP_Jewell Beyond me. Suppose I want to include your warning as an appendix to my Lord Paradox paper  https://t.co/38QW0n1JkC. How would you phrase it in the language of fig. 4 or 5. There are only Two Diets. When would your warning be violated?
