@yudapearl @PHuenermund @beyers_louw Rhetorically, I think the idea is to have one argument at a time. Some 'control' coefs may well also identify causal effects, but if they do so only in some set of structures, the choice between which doesn't affect identification of the effect of interest, they're distraction
