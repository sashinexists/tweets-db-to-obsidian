@EpiEllie @EpiDancer @MariaGlymour @autoregress Well, fwiw, on the ground IV seems to me out of favor with applied microeconomists for precisely the reasons you say.  Unless we are talking about reduced form estimation. I rarely see an IV and when I do (ex judge fixed effects), you increasingly see papers critical of it too.
