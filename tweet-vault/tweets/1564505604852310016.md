The long abandoned children of Shderot truly deserve a visit of their heroine Gal Gadot. She grew up among them (figuratively), we all did, and we all know what they had to experience past year. Still, the NYT considers their plight  unworthy of a mention. Thank you, @GalGadot https://t.co/W2N6hrYvKG
