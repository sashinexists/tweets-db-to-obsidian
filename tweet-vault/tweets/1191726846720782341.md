@fledglingStat @robertstats @stephensenn It does indeed. I was talking about the confounding step. Speaking about "explain outcome variability" is interesting, because "explain", again, is a causal, not statistical notion. I am curious how statisticians defined it in terms of "associations" #Bookofwhy
