@IvanWerning @steventberry @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @yudapearl @MariaGlymour @autoregress I see it as more about what the researcher is claiming about the model (whether that's true in practice is another story). Some papers are forthrightly descriptive: e.g. the median wage has changed this much over time (they're not claiming to know any counterfactuals).
