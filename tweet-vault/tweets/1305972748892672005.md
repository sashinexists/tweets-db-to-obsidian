@analisereal @PHuenermund @nickchk Do I have this right? Here the CATE is what Heckman calls the ‘variation free’ effect and @yudapearl calls E[Y|do(X=x)].

In this schooling example, this CATE is not how most would interpret “the effect of 6th grade”, so it isn’t the effect they’d want to estimate.
