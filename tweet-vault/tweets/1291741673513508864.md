@frankdevocht @cheryl_mcquire @petercraig200 @vkatikireddi @NIHRSPHR @_MiguelHernan @yudapearl I definitely prefer PO. I guess my point is that  ideal under PO is same population same time different intervention. Can't do this  but various study designs can substitute the missing PO. I think that splitting up designs misses that Rubin unified RCT and observational under PO
