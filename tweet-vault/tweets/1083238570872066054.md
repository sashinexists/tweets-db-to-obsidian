@jim_savage_ @Andrew___Baker @SueMarquezR @paulgp @jim_savage I am willing to take the test and would like to find out how "policy counterfactuals" can be constructed without the help of DAGs. Can we start with a simple "policy counterfactual" problem with 3-4 variables, so that we can see our way through it?  I am ready.
