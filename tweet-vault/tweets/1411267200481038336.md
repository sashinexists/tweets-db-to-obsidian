1/ I wish to correct my Tweet to @DavidHarrisAJC. After checking David's article in @Newsweek I find that he did mention Nancy Pelosi's roll in supporting @Ilhan reelection and in dismissing her unfitness. I commend @AJCGlobal for being perhaps the only mainstream organization https://t.co/DctiAdlo6X
