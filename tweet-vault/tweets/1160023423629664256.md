@IvanWerning @Jabaluck @steventberry @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @MariaGlymour @autoregress @IvanWening, the more I read your Tweets the more I agree with you (r u sure u r an economist?). The rearrangements you are permitting are permissible as long as they preserve information. Algebraic rearrangements are NOT information preserving. Nor are "Reduced forms" #Bookofwhy
