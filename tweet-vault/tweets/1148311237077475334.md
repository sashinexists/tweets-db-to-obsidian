@stephensenn @yudapearl Well, there are multiple topics being conflated in the discussion now. To avoid clutter, since I haven't heard this claim by anyone here, I would recommend Ch. 4 of the #bookofwhy where Fisher's contributions to the science of causal inference are, very carefully, put in context.
