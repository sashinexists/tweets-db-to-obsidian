@viktorklang @yudapearl It's possible this is just a linguistic thing, you can't even ask these two in my native tongue, so perhaps I'm missing some English meanings. You can always dig deeper, not just into "why", but also what is "we" and what is "come to be"? I still don't see the ambiguity though.
