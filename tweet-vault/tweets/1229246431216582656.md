@ondakondratiev @deborahlipstadt @IzaTabaro In my entire life I havn't heard anyone calling for the elimination of Iran or China from the surface of the earth, or calling whoever opposes the elimination "criminal" or subhuman. Linda Sarsour just said: Any one who humanizes Israelis is on the side of the "oppressor".
