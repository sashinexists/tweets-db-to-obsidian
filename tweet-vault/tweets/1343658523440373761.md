@yudapearl @lihua_lei_stat @ShalitUri @VC31415 @CasualBrady I've got an idea that might be useful. To consider the boundary cases in adjustment formulas: Define P(a|b)=
[P(a,b), P(b)] as an ordered pair. So the division is not done yet. Define P(a|b)P(b)=P(a,b) as usual. Then everything is the same and no division by zero.
