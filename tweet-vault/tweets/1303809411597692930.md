@tdietterich @KLdivergence Would you agree that statisticians are better at teach students to think about the data-generating process and the biases therein?

In my experience, MLer's tend to think little about where data comes from, and want to cure data problems with "data augmentation"ğŸ™„ğŸ™„ğŸ™„ğŸ™„
