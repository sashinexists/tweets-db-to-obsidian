@GaryMarcus @tdietterich @ylecun I wish I could join this discussion but I can't parse Tom's "DL provides grounding for the semantics of internal representations that current symbolic methods lack." In my simple world, it is symbolic representation that provides semantics, not DL. What am I missing?
