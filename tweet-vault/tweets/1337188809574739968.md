@VC31415 @economeager The point of "backdoor" is to take whatever knowledge your have about the word (be it 3, 4 or 100 relevant variables), find out if that knowledge is sufficient to answer your question by controlling for some measured variables and, if yes, who are they, then choose the best set.
