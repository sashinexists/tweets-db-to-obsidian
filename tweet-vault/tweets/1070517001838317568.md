@yudapearl @robertwplatt @zshahn @_MiguelHernan To me, a more useful separation is between causal effects we can estimate from data and those we canâ€™t. But that leads us back to our debate about non-well-defined interventions which neither of us seems likely to change our minds on, any time soon.
