@soboleffspaces @yudapearl Failure to organize random sampling for an RCT is by design.  Patients are entered who usually as part of established clinical practice.  Randomization allows A-B comparisons but does not allow A-O comparisons where O is a sample/population outside the stream of volunteers.
