@pierre_rochard @ercwl @100trillionUSD @JohnMarkoff2 But what IS this remarkable relationship? Can you show it in just 3-4 variables and 3 time slots? I would like to add it to my list of "remarkable" relationships of correlated variables. If it is truly remarkable, it should be demonstrable in 3-4 variables. Curious #Bookofwhy
