@yudapearl @RandomlyWalking @raamana_ Hmm, I think eventually, someone had to guess at random, for instance to devise a path diagram. Then s/he could validate it and determine path coefficients. Reading #bookofwhy I understood that path diagrams are not _in_ data, but data satisfies a diagram. Did I get it wrong?
