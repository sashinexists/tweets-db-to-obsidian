@stephensenn @RonKenett @learnfromerror Whats the point of challenging DAGs to do this or that when I am trying to understand what this or that is? I am coming to you as a student, and you take a defensive position as if I was a threat. I am interested only in  the mental process behind the choice of blocks.#Bookofwhy
