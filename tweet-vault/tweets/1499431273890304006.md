@stephensenn @yudapearl @f2harrell @soboleffspaces @SMuellerLab If we just create a list of 1000 people for A and 1000 people for B and start calling people on the phone to ask if they want to be in the trial, we may end up with 183 that agreed to enroll from the “A” list and 242 that agreed to enroll from the “B” list
