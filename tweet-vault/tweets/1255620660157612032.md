@tdietterich @yudapearl @StanfordHAI This is why Iâ€™m so drawn to simulation-based inference &amp; probprog... the simulators are causal, generative models. DL can be used as surrogates for these models. Or we can make simulators differentiable, instrument probprog, and port new techniques you a more native model.
