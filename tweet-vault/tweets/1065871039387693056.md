The relation between RL (Reinforcement Learning) and causal inference has been a topic of some debate. It can be resolved, I believe, by understanding the limits of each. RL authors call this limit "off-policy". I like "off-knobs", imagining a machine with finite number of knobs. https://t.co/nr6tbENinF
