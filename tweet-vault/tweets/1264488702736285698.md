@yudapearl @PHuenermund @beyers_louw To be clear imho the idea is that this is a rhetorical strategy, not a claim about what is identified and how. It has the standard economics audience as a target. A more engineering systems audience would presumably prize a fuller model over a narrowly estimated effect.
