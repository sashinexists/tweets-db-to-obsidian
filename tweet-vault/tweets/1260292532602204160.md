@causalinf @GivingTools @yudapearl @KetchupEconomi1 @sterndavidi The honoraria paid to AEA editors are not available in the association's annual report (papers &amp; proceedings). However as a 501(c)(3) AEA must file IRS 990, which is a public document.

For calendar year 2018, lead editors at the AEA journals were paid $83k-123k. https://t.co/SdXCVXkGK0
