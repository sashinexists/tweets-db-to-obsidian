@LomaahhMore @aynumazi @yudapearl @AOC @deborahlipstadt @bellingcat There's all these little Palestinian sites that pretty clearly don't do journalistic standards. I'm always triangulating. But yeah-I saw the headlines everywhere that there'd be no investigation but in US-speak that's 'no criminal probe even though the military will investigate'.
