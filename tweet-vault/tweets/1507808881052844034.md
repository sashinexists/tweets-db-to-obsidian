@soboleffspaces @attilacsordas In SCM, the justification of consistency is easy. It goes: What is Y(x,u)? It is defined by the First Law. Therefore, consistency is a proven Theorem. In PO, Y(x,u) is defined by intuition about treatments, individuals and outcomes. Therefore, consistency must rest on intuition.
