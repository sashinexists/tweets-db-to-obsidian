What a beautiful satellite photo of Israel, with patches of lights marking Tel-Aviv, Jerusalem, Haifa, Amman and Cairo. Even Cyprus and Turkey can be seen in the distance, and the Sinai Peninsula amazes you again why it took 40 years for the Israelites to reach the holy land. https://t.co/JdFCcHsW6a
