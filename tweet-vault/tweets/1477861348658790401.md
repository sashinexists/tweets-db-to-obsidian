@yudapearl @Ya3il8200 @blakeflayton Normalcy and dignity exist differently for Jews in the US and Israel — one is based on constitutional equality and the other stems from systemic inequity and an ugly history of war and oppression. I prefer the American form of dignity because it doesn’t come at others’ expense.
