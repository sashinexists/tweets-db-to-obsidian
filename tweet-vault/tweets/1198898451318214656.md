@yudapearl @JustinTrudeau Israel killed my friend Einas Shreiteh in front of my eyes and her mother's, only for waving a Palestinian flag. Israel is the reason Assad is still the watch dog for the northern borders. We Syrians know that. Israel didn't attack us directly, airstrikes are only against Iran.
