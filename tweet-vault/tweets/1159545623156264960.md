@Jabaluck @fuzzydunlop123 @yudapearl @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @MariaGlymour @autoregress To be clear, I don't think Phil is critiquing simple structural models, he is embracing them in appropriate situations. I think he is critiquing (as would you) the approach in which someone refuses to defend a such a model with "it's just reduced form".
