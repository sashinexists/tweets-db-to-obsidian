@cdsamii @yudapearl @PHuenermund @dhillon_p @deaneckles It seems ID was assumed away thr C1-3, or, am I missing smth? Is this what you meant by "old stuff" &amp; solved? C1 seems to be the core assumption, which Paul's ref grounds in a formal way. We have 3 bullets discussing this issue, not sure u are familiar w/ https://t.co/PY3KLwbxgW.
