@yudapearl @Lester_Domes @EpiEllie @ConiByera @LucyStats @AlexaYakubovich @AnjaLeist @rohitpojha @AbbyCScience @_MiguelHernan @casualinfer (Re the original discussion, it seems that there is a subtlety of whether trying to estimate Y(x) for a given x counts as causal if you donâ€™t also estimate it for other values of x. I think everyone agrees tho that the whole function itself is ultimately the causal relationship?)
