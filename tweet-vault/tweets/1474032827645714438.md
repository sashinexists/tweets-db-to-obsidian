@soboleffspaces @RWJE_BA @yudapearl @PavlosMsaouel @f2harrell @smueller @ChristosArgyrop @AndrewPGrieve @HL327 1/2) I think it is interesting to have an alternative approach. However, as I have already expressed in my comments I have some scepticism as to whether one could justify the necessary assumptions in a case like this. I would find @HL327 's solution more plausible.
