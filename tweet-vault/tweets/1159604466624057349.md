@fuzzydunlop123 @Jabaluck @PHuenermund @steventberry @Jacobb_Douglas @MariaGlymour @autoregress If someone succeeded in eliminating the word "design" from the literature (perhaps leave it in RCT contexts) clarity will shine brightly on causality-land. A catch-all for "I wish to be more specific". I  hope it's avoided in #Bookofwhy. Just checked, it's used mostly harmlessly.
