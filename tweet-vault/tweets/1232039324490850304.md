@yudapearl @jim_savage_ @Jabaluck @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @MariaGlymour @autoregress I think in our earlier conversation, we concluded that you should ignore the whole discussion of "reduced form." One point of the slides is that its use in Econ is confusing. Which leaves the answer: structural.
