@EpiEllie @l__ds @malco_barrett @NeuroStats @ken_rothman If a PIE helps "visualize how interaction could arise" then I expect someone to be able to look at the PIE and tell whether "interaction could arise". This amount to "detecting" interaction. So, how do we tell interactions (or some other  relation) by looking at a set of PIEs ?
