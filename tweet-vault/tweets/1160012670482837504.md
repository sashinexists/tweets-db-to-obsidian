@Jabaluck @alexpghayes @steventberry @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @yudapearl @MariaGlymour @autoregress I’m more just thinking - given any ‘causal process’, how do I represent and model it. Using eg algebraic/functional equations like a =f(b,c,d) is already limiting in expressiveness to me. (Weirdly I did my undergrad in continuum mechanics...and operations research!)
