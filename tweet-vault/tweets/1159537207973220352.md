@Jabaluck @yudapearl @PHuenermund @MariaGlymour Do you know of a good source for proving PO statements can be expressed in DAGs? I took a few hours to try to parse "An Axiomatic Characterization of Causal Counterfactuals," and it seems to (a) only cover PO conditional equality conjunctions and (b) require a causal ordering
