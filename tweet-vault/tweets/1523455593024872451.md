Peter Beinart was born in 1971, after Yasser Arafat decided to Westernize his struggle into "equality and freedom." I was 11 yrs old in 1947 when Azzam Pasha (Arab League) echoed Hamas, and honestly called the Palestinian struggle: "a war of extermination and momentous massacre." https://t.co/PWakrXIxqU
