@JohnMullahy @lewbel Glad you mention Boole-Fr√©chet bounds. We have a nice blog post on these bounds, see https://t.co/EUudpbK3QH. Yet remarkably, the bounds can be narrowed *significantly* if we have both randomized and observational data https://t.co/ZhBuNWD0Cw, not sure if economists are aware of.
