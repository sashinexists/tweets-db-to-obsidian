@HannesMalmberg1 @maximananyev @yudapearl My point in that specific discussion was that @yudapearl purports to be teaching people how to conduct causal inference but he's missing a core element of the story (design). I think I agree with your point about structure, although wouldn't attribute it to Pearl.
