@eliasbareinboim @EpiEllie @leskocar The PO perspective has advanced considerably in the past decade. It started with "DAGs are not helpful", and advanced to "DAGs are helpful but only to verify ignorability". I now see it heading towards: "Ignorability is not really needed" #Bookofwy #causalinference
