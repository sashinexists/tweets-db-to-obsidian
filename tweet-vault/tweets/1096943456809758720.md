@intensivemargin @CarterPaddy @mkessler_DC @t0nyyates That question of estimating ALPHA is identical to the issue of "bad control" being addressed in MHE. If you can distinguish "bad control" from "good control" you also know whether ALPHA is estimable by OLS.  Thanks for bringing up the relation between these two issues. #Bookofwhy
