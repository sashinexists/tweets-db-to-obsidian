@johndawkins @athie_gnome @gibletsMoon @rasmansa Okay. But you are incorrect that there is any technical sense in which correlation is defined by linearity. Only certain types of correlations (Pearsonâ€™s being the most prominent) are defined by linearity. I was pointing out that even Pearson being a default is a bad thing.
