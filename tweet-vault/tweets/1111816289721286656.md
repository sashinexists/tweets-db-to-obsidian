@steventberry @Jabaluck Do you mean "causal" or  "casual"? If casual, I wonder why "You could make the same mistake with DAGs," I can't recall seeing even one student making "control" mistake with DAGs. Have you? And btw, did the ancient religion ever discuss the issue of adding "controls"? #Bookofwhy
