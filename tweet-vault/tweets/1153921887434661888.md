@yudapearl @tdietterich @zittrain @eliasbareinboim @suchisaria Summary: IRM observes x,y pairs from multiple domains/environments E (different interventions). It then exploits this to learn a representation Z= Φ (X) of observes variables X such that it renders the domain E and label Y (approximately) conditionally independent. Z ∐E| Φ (X)
