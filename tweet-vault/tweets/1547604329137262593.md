@JohanDH2O @Lizstuartdc @nickchk I agree NDE(t) and NIE(t) would be sufficient, since each effect implies what changes and t refers to units under T=t. Still, they show that TE﹣NDE(0) ≠ NIE(0) which is important asymmetry.

Notice that @yudapearl defines NIE(1) as EY1M0-EY1M1 and therefore
TE = NDE(0)﹣NIE(1)
