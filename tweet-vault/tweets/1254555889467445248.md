@stuartbuck1 @PHuenermund @quantadan @maximananyev 1/ I confess to not knowing everything about "how economists think and reason about ignorability" because my knowledge comes primarily from published articles, which may not reveal the entire process through which authors "think". I would therefore be grateful to you if you could
