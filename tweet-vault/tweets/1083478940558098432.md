@cdsamii @PHuenermund @dhillon_p @deaneckles @eliasbareinboim Paul is right. Even if the issue is estimation, readers need to know what identification method is used, what assumptions are made, and perhaps what asymptotic results
prevail. Your paper sounds like solving an identification problem. Why not help readers?
