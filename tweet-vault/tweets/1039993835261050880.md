@JenMandelbaum @quantadan @MyaLRoberson Arrows do not address, they describe. The question before us is how, after unpacking and re-unpacking all the multitude of factors,  we describe in our model that some employers will let hiring decisions be influenced by the candidate race? An arrow can do that. Any alternative?
