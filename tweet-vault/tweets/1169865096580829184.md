@yudapearl @PHuenermund @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal I'm saying that you think DAG building is easy -- just encode your assumptions! But that's not sufficient. Depending what procedure you use to synthesize the complex world into a simple DAG, you will end up with very different DAGs, some of which are far better than others.
