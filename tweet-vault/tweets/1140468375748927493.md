1/2 "tools with which to think about models" is only one usage of DAGs. Another usage is computational; DAGs permit us to answer questions which otherwise are intractable. E.g.,"Tell me if the partial correlation R_{XY.Z} is zero", or "Tell me which parameter is estimable by OLS" https://t.co/6cAU4WGXsM
