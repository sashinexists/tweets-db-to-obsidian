@PHuenermund @dlmillimet @instrumenthull @paulgp @pietrobiroli Agree on the guilt of early PO literature and the awesome damage it has caused, just because it didn't have a better analogy than "target trials." Thucydides did not wait for "trials" in concluding that it was the earthquake that caused the tsunami.
