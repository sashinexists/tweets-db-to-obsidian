@VC31415 @soboleffspaces The two are not equivalent, because a do-expression is a population property, not a unit-level property. A drug for which P(y|do(X=x)) is not a function of x can still cure some patients and kill others. In comparison, Y(x,u) = Y(x',u) for all x,x',u says the drug has no effect.
