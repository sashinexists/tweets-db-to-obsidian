It was great fun talking at your conference and assuming (wrongly) that audience never heard about causal inference. Thanks for posting this very slide "What is Causal Inference?" which is so timely in view of conversations we are having on Twitter and on @StatModeling #Bookofwhy https://t.co/Rk7iGlxoGJ
