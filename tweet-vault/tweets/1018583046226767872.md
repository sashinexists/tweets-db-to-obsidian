@f2harrell @eliasbareinboim I am not familiar with any statistical notion of "right" or "exact" or even "better" etc. that is not based on large n asymptotics. But I may be missing on my statistics education. Can you walk me through one example where those notions are defined
with no ref. to asymptotics?
