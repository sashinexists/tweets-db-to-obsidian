@Jabaluck @ho_ben @causalinf @Susan_Athey No need to reassure me that you are not DAG-averse, I can see that, and I consider it an asset to econometric education. I wish more scholars like you would approach the arrow-phobic cult of econometric and say: Come on, it shows, and it is embarrassing all of us.   #Bookofwhy
