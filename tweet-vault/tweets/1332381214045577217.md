@yudapearl @causalinf @PHuenermund @econbookclub @steventberry @Chris_Auld @analisereal @jdramirezc @PhilHaile The book mostly raises semantics. A structural model can say Y depends on X, X depends on Z while reduced form might only say Y and X are functions of Z. The book calls these two different kinds of causality. Could instead say they're diff info sets possessed by the economist.
