@Jabaluck @dlmillimet @snavarrol @yudapearl @a40ruhr @causalinf @PossebomVitor @nickchk Why an easy way to fool yourself? If you believe in modularity, which is at the heart of econometrics, then single causal mechanisms (i.e., edges  in a DAG) identified by one study should be informative in other  contexts, even if the research questions differ slightly.
