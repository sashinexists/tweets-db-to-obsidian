@fmg_twtr @kinggary @LydiaManiatis @CMichaelGibson @joshgeleris @CNN @NEJM Interesting! Why shouldn't conditioning on the PS be the same (asymptotically) as conditioning on those covartiates? Eq. (11.10) in  https://t.co/BYnjoEsn8D states that they should be the same. Some colliders do NOT induce dependence among their parents, and PS is such a collider
