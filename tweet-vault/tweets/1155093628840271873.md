@paulgp @PEngzell @patrickaturley Not me. I wrote about if some of the Xs were incorrectly treated as exogenous. I suspect if they are all exo, then you interpret them as usual... consistent estimates of the marginal effects of X for the pop since you use all the variation in X to estimate beta. @PHuenermund ?
