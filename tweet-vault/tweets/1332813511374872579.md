@lewbel @yudapearl @causalinf @PHuenermund @econbookclub @Chris_Auld @analisereal @jdramirezc @PhilHaile I disagree with Arthur here. Operations that preserve counterfactuals yield equivalent models and the equivalent model is still the same  "structural" model. Arthur is correct that we like to motivate models by thinking about behavior.
