This still leaves us with an unresolved puzzle: What makes learning with "deep pockets" produce better performance than "shallow pockets"? We've ruled out "bigger data". So what remains? Could it be selection bias? i.e., run many more studies, select the successful, call them FM. https://t.co/9ffBrx47ey
