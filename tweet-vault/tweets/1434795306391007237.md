@yudapearl @bjorn_hogberg Isn't d most elegant/simplest theory tht explains the empirical data chosen? As an amateur dabbler in AICogSci thats wht comes to my mind: the notion tht known as Occam's Razor.  Now d question u ask I paraphrase as : Why we find certain theories more elegant/simple/intuitive?
