Why "my" historical infancy? Good question. Because my Bar Mitzva reading was from Book of Isaiah (60:1): "Arise,  Jerusalem, your light has come!" So, I feel a personal attachment to the Book of Isaiah in the Dead Sea Scroll, and to the two scribes who wrote it 2,200 years ago. https://t.co/oDcSU1oMBn
