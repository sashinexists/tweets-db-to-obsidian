@amine_ouazad @shell_ki Right! "Ignorability" is not a statistical concept despite the fact that it is dressed in probability outfits and sings the songs of conditional independence. The causal character of this concept is betrayed by the counterfactual variable Y(1), which is not an observed variable.
