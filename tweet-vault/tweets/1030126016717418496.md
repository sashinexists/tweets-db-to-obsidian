@EpiEllie @yudapearl @l__ds @NeuroStats @ken_rothman This also brings up an interesting difference. In DAGs, interaction is assumed to exist and implicit, but in pies, it's explicit. What's shown are the exact causes necessary for interaction. Presumably there's some unshown set of incomplete pies that don't add up to D happening?
