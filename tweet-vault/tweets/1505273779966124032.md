@artistexyz @stephensenn @soboleffspaces @yudapearl @ADAlthousePhD @JFronczekMD @EpiEllie @f2harrell @statsepi @GuyattGH @GRADE_WG My view of an ATE RRs, etc is that they have to be based well powered RCTs. I agree that our understanding of the underlying mechanisms is too poor  to have much confidence in causal reasoning when so many multiple damaging &amp; reparative causes may be involved.
