@yudapearl @djvanness @ConiByera @AndersHuitfeldt For example, there are some concepts that appear in models we would call causal that cannot be expressed in SCMs (no matter how non-parametric, an initial assumption of ‘model class is SCM’ has been made). Is ‘interaction’ a concept that is formalised in SCMs (&amp;/or DAGs) or not?
