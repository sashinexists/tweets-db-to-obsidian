@yudapearl @DavidDeutschOxf @DouglasCarswell I agree with that statement, but I'm a bit surprised because so few people I've talked to see neural networks as evolutionary. Can you point me to appropriate literature on the subject (of ANNs being evolutionary)? I want to be able to point people to it.
