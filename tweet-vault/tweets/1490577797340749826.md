My most painful disappointment is seeing colleagues at my university legitimizing the barbarity of Hamas. It started here: https://t.co/QyHpCPGt33 and is still going on here: https://t.co/AEdNq4OEKi.
Hamas counts on their support when celebrating  death of a holocaust survivor. https://t.co/xKzR70WxFf
