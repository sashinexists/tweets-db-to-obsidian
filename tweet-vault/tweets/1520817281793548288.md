@tetraduzione @yudapearl To be fair, I have mixed feelings about this song. As an Italian, it moves me because to me it represents antifascism and the Resistance. As a Slovenian, I agree with the sarcastic undertones in Pankrti, especially keeping in mind Yugoslavia was a totalitarian comunist regime.
