@HL327 @stephensenn @soboleffspaces @yudapearl @ADAlthousePhD @JFronczekMD @EpiEllie @f2harrell @statsepi @GuyattGH @GRADE_WG Where we disagree:
One can envision health care scenarios that are not dynamic (i.e., not cyclic) ATE  can be defined for those too.The original def of ATE was for a non-cyclic process. Generalization to  cyclic process is as just described. So def of ATE in terms of feebk  wrong
