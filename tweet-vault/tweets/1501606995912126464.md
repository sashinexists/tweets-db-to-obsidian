@davidshalev6 @polyglotme @mehdirhasan I sometimes wonder where Putin got the idea that he can wake up one day and define a neighbor as: (1) not a democracy,2) not a country in the modern sense
3) not a fulfillment of self-determination. He must have been listening to @Mehdirhasan1 or his mentors at BDS + Al-Jazerra.
