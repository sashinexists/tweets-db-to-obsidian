@yudapearl @aecoppock @SonjaASwanson @_MiguelHernan @graemedblair @jasperjcooper Our read is that U1 matters: even if Z's a perfect instrumnt we need further assumptns to estimte the ATE of X on Y (tho we can get bounds, as you show). If we settle for a LATE estimand, knowing if U1 affects X or Z helps us figure who the compliers are. Have we gotten it wrong?
