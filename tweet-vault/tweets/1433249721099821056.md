@Grady_Booch @SFMagus I han't seen it yet and, in general, I evaluate principles, not codes. For this I need to go to
the citation provided https://t.co/7Bpf8FSqdw
which, on the surface, appears good, though I can't find the First &amp; Second Laws of causal inference, nor the Ladder, so I'm uneasy.
