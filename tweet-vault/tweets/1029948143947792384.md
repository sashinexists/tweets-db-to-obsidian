@thosjleeper @TheBrettGall In #Bookofwhy I praise Morgan and Winship for saving social science from the fate of economics. Indeed they cover both sides, missing one tiny step -- showing that the two sides are ONE. Namely, results obtained in one are obtainable in the other. A DAG generates all PO's.
