@f2harrell @stephensenn @soboleffspaces @AndrewPGrieve @PavlosMsaouel How can we say NNT is deficient if we haven't defined it? I believe the EBM folks tried to capture individual decision making but lacked a language to do so; all they had was the language of RCT. Bottom line: Do you believe we can rectify their confusion with today's tools?
