@Vieroe @SamerAbdelnour Nice theory, except it does not match with facts. The besiegement started in 1936 (no occupation) when Haj Amin al Husseini declared a boycott on Jewish products, and a genocide by entrapment on European Jews seeking refuge from Hitler (My grandparents were among the entrapped).
