@jasonintrator @glogauer_jakob Yes, I work on this. What is it that I highlighted "over" other facts? Isn't Palestinian rejectionism a fact that cannot be "over highlighted" when it comes to prospects for peace, lifting the occupation, and almost every issue youngsters care about. Do you talk to them
about it?
