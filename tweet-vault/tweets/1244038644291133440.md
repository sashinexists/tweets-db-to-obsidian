Another thought evoked by your informative description of survey methods. Since these methods rely on the "no-confounding" assumption, how did survey experts articulate this assumption mathematically? Or they just carried it in the head? What's in the tech literature? #Bookofwhy https://t.co/QtFkpbIUX5
