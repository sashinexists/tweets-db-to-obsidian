@instrumenthull @PHuenermund @paulgp @dlmillimet @pietrobiroli @yudapearl @eliasbareinboim @josh_t_dean I definitely think these studies are useful! I just don’t think they constitute a clear example of making a decision “because of” race (ie direct impact of race). Which I thought was your original point.
