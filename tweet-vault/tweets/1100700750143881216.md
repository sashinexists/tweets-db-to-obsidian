@HenningStrandin @kareem_carr I would take X=x to mean "the gravitational pull at the molecule location is a vector x." And I would not even think about changing the moon location. I would compare rushing under X=x to rushing under X = x' and that would give me the causal effect of X on Y. #Bookofwhy
