I've always wondered, but was afraid to ask: How does "lifelong learning" differ from “transfer learning,” or “domain adaptation." In other words, would there be a problem of "lifelong learning" if domains stayed constant? Or,
won't LLL be solved if we solved "transfer learning? https://t.co/Ocqg5yIPiO
