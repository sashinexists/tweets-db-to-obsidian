@PhilHaile @steventberry Beautiful! Now we see that it is not really "all else   held fixed" but only "all other arguments in a certain equation are held fixed". Thus, things boil down to the question what qualifies some variables as arguments in some equations to the exclusion of others. Any criterion?
