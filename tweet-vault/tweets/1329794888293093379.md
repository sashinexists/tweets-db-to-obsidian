@psforscher @peder_isager @dingding_peng @fdabl @yudapearl According to the graph, adjusting / controlling for age should not block the confounding path of exp. However, I found that when you simulate that, controlling of age does indeed reduces the bias of exp (in my sim, to 50%). Absolutely no clue why @dingding_peng your turn ðŸ¤£
