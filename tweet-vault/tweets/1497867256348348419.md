@GeraldNGOM @DavidHirsh @schraubd Hijackers of Jewish education truly do not understand how central Israel is to most donors, and to most Jews who haven't bowed to social acceptance. Perhaps the analogy of hiring a Kahanist to head a Center of Palestine Studies would tickle some understanding of that centrality.
