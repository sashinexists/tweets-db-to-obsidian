@BedecarratsF @VC31415 @PHuenermund I don't think it makes sense to cover topic X following someone who never used X. Imbens (2019) is a good example of someone talking ABOUT DAGS who never used one and, thus, fails to present their merits and limitations; I detail his failures here: https://t.co/sZPpL7Ifmg
