@omaclaren @statwonk @yudapearl @PHuenermund I prefer to discuss the specifics. Can the HM "framework" help to compute P(T | do(S)) when f_S, f_T, f_C Y &amp; P(G, U) are unknown, but observational data+G are available? I already gave my answer, difficult to be more clear: HM can't help! Feel free to show me wrong.
