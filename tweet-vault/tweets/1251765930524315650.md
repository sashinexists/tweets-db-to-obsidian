@yudapearl @unsorsodicorda I’d caution/note that there’s differences between the more recent machine learning literature and the inverse problems/statistics literature. Lots of cool stuff in ML but often rediscovering exisiting work and/or just using neural nets to learn surrogate models (ie mimic DEs)
