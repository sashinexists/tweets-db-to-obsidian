@noranta4 @TacoCohen @FrancescoLocat8 @eliasbareinboim @saramagliacane @JorisMooij @bschoelkopf @carlorovelli @seanmcarroll @rosemary_ke I always look at SCM as a computational embodiment of Popper's philosophy, in which falsifiability and, in particular "explanation" (rung-3) are given concrete, algorithmic interpretations. Is there a Popperian desiderata that is not achievable in SCM?
