Illuminating!! Thanks Paul for posting this rare pre-revolution relic of causal analysis in economics. I wish all our readers take a look at these articles, one by one, and marvel at the progress made in the past 3 decades. I love the phrase: "causality has been hard to define" https://t.co/RxhKY1u8xy
