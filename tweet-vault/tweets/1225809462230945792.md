@yudapearl @PHuenermund You don’t like the target trial framework so of course you don’t think it’s the right direction. But I’m up to chapter 2 and so far I have no major quibbles with this book (although I did shudder at calling a clear case of confounding “selection bias”—if only they’d used a DAG!!)
