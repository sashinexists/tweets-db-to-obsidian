@yudapearl @amitabhchandra2 “Demand” in this context doesn’t mean protests or appeals. It means future visibility and citations. Editors see important papers using a new tool and become convinced a review paper will be impactful by appealing to a wide audience. “Demand” is consumer demand from researchers.
