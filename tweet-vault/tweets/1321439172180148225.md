Hilarious! Worth every word! I bet some of Beinart's disciples will take it seriously and will ask Peter to confirm publically that He, only He is the real author of that Purim Shpiel in Jewish Current, and that he actually believes that Israel created Arab oppression. Hilarious! https://t.co/lyE4HIyCFL
