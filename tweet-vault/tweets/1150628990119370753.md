@ZionessMovement @CoryBooker Thank you @ZionessMovement for joining my Twitter and for informing me of how @CoryBooker and VC Biden responded to IfNotNow squeeks. I neve say the Israeli Palestinian conflict is "COMPLEX". It is baby simple: One side says "we, we, we" and the other "me, me, me". Baby simple.
