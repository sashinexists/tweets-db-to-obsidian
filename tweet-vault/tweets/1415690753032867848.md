@SRMandeles @Yale @FatmaYasier Before applying for a job or graduate school, Yale graduates would need to state on their resume whether they were "educated" before or after the Orwellian take-over of their "education".  And this is not "discrimination", just precaution, like "have you ever been arrested?"
