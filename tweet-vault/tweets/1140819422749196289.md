@yudapearl @Corey_Yanofsky @stephensenn @omaclaren FE= fixed effect, as in a structural equation y=bx where the effect b is a constant (although usually unknown) across units (people, or studies, or).
RE= random effects, as in a structural equation y=bx where the effect b varies randomly across units.
Any graphical distinction?
