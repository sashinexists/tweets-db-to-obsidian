@yudapearl @djvanness @ConiByera @AndersHuitfeldt I have a model of a mechanism/pathway of causation X-&gt;Y and another of Z-&gt;Y, both with data collected in isolation of the other. Can I predict what happens when I combine both to get X-&gt;Y, Z-&gt;Y without collecting data on Y(X,Z)? How would I express it when I think I can?
