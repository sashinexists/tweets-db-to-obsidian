@Peninha_13 @yudapearl It looks like Pearl's text was hyperbolic. Yes, Euclid does indeed give definitions for point and line (which cannot therefore be truly primitives). But that is not important. What is important is that you can change those definitions as you like and the geometry keeps the same.
