@yudapearl @EpiEllie @AndersHuitfeldt @PHuenermund @causalinf @HenningStrandin @nickchk In teaching, consistent notation saves time... And it often helps to quickly connect ideas, e.g., PNS= P(Y_1=1, Y_0=0) instead of P(y_x, y'_x') clearly shows that we are looking at quantities learned at Level 2.
