@eliasbareinboim @statwonk @yudapearl @PHuenermund So the question is eg - suppose we set up a physical model involving smoking, tar, cancer and a gene in the form given, simulated data from it under arbitrary conditions and gave just S, T, C data, could we derive the front door adjustment formula?
