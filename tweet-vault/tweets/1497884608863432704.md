@schraubd @DavidHirsh I was not referring to the Nazarian Center, and you are minimizing the danger of appointing a person viewing Israel as a liability to head up a Center to which Israel need be an inspiration. There is such a thing as "fit"; we dont appoint a creationist to head a dpt of evolution.
