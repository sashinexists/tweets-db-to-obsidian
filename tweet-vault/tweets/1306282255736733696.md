@m_clem @PHuenermund @julianschuess @nickchk @yudapearl So the problem here is different---we have a latent variable  causing X and Y, that is, X &lt;--U--&gt; Y. Here indeed adjusting for Z could make things worse, but we cannot tell a priori as that depends on the strength of associations with X and Y.
