@eigenhector @ericjang11 @eliasbareinboim @jasonhartford @dustinvtran @zacharylipton @CsabaSzepesvari @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @ShalitUri In CI, we call it "functional model" or "completely specified structural model", where the response of each listening variable is functionally defined. In such a model all counterfactual queries, conditional as well as marginals, are estimable. Why invoke quantum? #Bookofwhy
