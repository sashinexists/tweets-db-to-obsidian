@quantadan @AgEconomist @PHuenermund @causalinf @Susan_Athey I am inclined to trust things coming from deepminds, because they have read #Bookofwhy, and probably tried their algorithm on the firing squad example. What concerns me are the words "probability trees" because the Ladder tells us you can't get counterfactuals from probability.
