@wagonomics @paulgp @AlexBartik I would love a discussion just around this one. This whole “easily captured” business is worth unpacking and clarifying. I think he means DAGs and PO are equivalent descriptions of the same thing so therefore they have to both do it well. Not sure if that must be true.
