I am flattered by your tweet, but it reminds me that my son, Daniel, when he copy edited my 1988 book "Probabilistic Reasoning", told me: Dad, you better take a class in basic journalistic writing; your sentences must be "clear and succinct." I'm still trying to heed his advice. https://t.co/di6Np4ifbt
