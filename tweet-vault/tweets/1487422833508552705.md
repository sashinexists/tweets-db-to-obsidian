@Scholars4Peace @SAFECUNY Depressing and well documented report by @ADL. Unfortunately, it ends with another "Oy Vey"; no "war cabinet" and no plan for counterattack. The word Zionophobia (or equivalent) does not appear even once. Things will turn around when we learn to spell Zionophobia. @JGreenblattADL
