Thank you @CoryBooker for refusing to fall into the trap of treating complex probs of MiddleEast as a binary,as if all blame for Israeli Palestinian conflict falls on the Jewish state,as if one side is good &amp; the other (the Jews) are evil,as if this can be boiled into a soundbite https://t.co/Ug8OqC6gNL
