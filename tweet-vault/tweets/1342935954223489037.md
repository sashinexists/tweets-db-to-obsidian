@VC31415 @CasualBrady Agreed formally it is not, which is why CG literature had to address it too/ My intention was that when with finite samples this issue often becomes prominent, which I think explains the elevated status of this assumption in the stats-causal lit, vs. just a short nod in CG lit https://t.co/2ewrheUVMb
