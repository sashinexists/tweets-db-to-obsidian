@saramagliacane @yudapearl @TacoCohen @JorisMooij @bschoelkopf @carlorovelli @seanmcarroll @FrancescoLocat8 @rosemary_ke Feel free to add your promo, of course, but it's a technical comment since there is a claim that the problem discussed is called X. If that's true, there is a full solution available to X. We did compare explicitly against the method you mentioned, pls, check Appendix D2 (p. 19).
