@PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @yudapearl @MariaGlymour @autoregress My point was that the need for an identification strategy is orthogonal to whether you have a reduced form or structural model in economics-speak (not in @yudapearl language). In econ-speak, a structural model involves writing an explicit optimization problem.
