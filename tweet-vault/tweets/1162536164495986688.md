@optempirics @FatWhiteFamily I confirm your suspicion that everything you can represent in a DAG you can also represent in math equations. The former is an abstraction of the latter. Now, to appreciate the former, take any 3 variables in the latter and check if X is independent of Y given Z. #Bookofwhy
