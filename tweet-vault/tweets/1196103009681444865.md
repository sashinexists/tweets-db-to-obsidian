@yudapearl @stephensenn @RonKenett @learnfromerror Great question which I'll defer to Stephen.  But it's worth considering the hypothetical case where this is theoretically only one blocking variable in a randomized experiment (e.g. myocardium at risk).  Crossover designs are great models for discussion.
