@AsraNomani @VanderbiltU @vsg_vanderbilt @yudapearl @esanzi @DPearlProject @TheMuslimReform @Raheelraza @JGreenblattADL @ADL @Vanderbilt made a big effort to recruit Jews &amp; Asians , who helped push it into the top rank of universities. The problem on many of these campuses is not the administration, but big chunks of the faculty &amp; esp. the students who are steeped in this vicious race-based ideology.
