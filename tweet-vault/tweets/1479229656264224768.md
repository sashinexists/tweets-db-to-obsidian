IMO @yudapearl taxonomy of nodes in dependency graphs beats his CSM framework. Indeed, simply knowing that some nodes are pre-treatment factors and that they are related to outcome determinants thru a chain of dependency makes it possible to read X â†’ Y causality off the graph. https://t.co/grfFcAJ6Ke
