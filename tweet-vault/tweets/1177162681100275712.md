Thank you, @juli_schuess for creating this thread. It is both an honor to the winners and an invitation to statistics educators to enrich the perspectives of their students with new tools and new understanding. The class material is all there: Books, slides and notes. #Bookofwhy https://t.co/WtvY3VxtgM
