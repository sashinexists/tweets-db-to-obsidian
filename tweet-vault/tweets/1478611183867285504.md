@tdietterich @BomNaKub @roydanroy Some actions have names of their own, unrelated to the world, e.g., "do instruction-15". Others are named by their effects. In the latter case, a confusion may arise between seeing that a_t occured, vs. making a_t occur; the latter changes s_t, not the former. Do(a_t) separates.
