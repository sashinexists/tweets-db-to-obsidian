@causalinf @steventberry @paulgp @lewbel @yudapearl I proposed many tweets ago that one way to think about the motivation for certain PO approaches is to imagine a world where any DAG you write down has a high probability of being misspecified in specific ways (i.e. you miss 80% of backdoor paths).
