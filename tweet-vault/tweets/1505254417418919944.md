@HL327 @stephensenn @soboleffspaces @yudapearl @ADAlthousePhD @JFronczekMD @EpiEllie @f2harrell @statsepi @GuyattGH @GRADE_WG I agree with 90% of what you said. I would model the process you have described by a dynamic Bayesian network (e.g.,  Kalman Filter). https://t.co/zaoNPVvB0p
DBNs represent feedback! At the end of each time slice (i.e., cycle), I would calculate both ATE and bounds on  PNS. 1/2
