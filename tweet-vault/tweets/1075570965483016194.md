@jon_y_huang @yudapearl For sure. I would love if we were all at the stage where our only point of disagreement was which assumptions hold for a *specific* example. There’s a lot of work to be done first on convincing people the assumptions can *ever* hold &amp; what methods to use if they do or don’t hold.
