@VC31415 @JaapAbbring @Chris_Auld @DonskerClass @lewbel @PhilHaile @steventberry I am not clear what "Agnostics are skeptical about", when it is such an easy matter to express skepticism (in assumptions) using the economic models themselves. You do not "impose a heavier structure" by hiding the structure needed for your method to work.
