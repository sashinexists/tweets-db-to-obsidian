@yudapearl @fuzzydunlop123 @autoregress @MariaGlymour @PHuenermund @EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer @metrics52 The paper discusses extensively how to justify the exclusion restriction. It doesn't use your preferred formalism for doing so, but that is not the same as not doing so! Read the paper. Do you believe their estimates? Why or why not?
