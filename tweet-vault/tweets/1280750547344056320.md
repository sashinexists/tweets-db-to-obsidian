@yudapearl @mjdramstead @Prof_Livengood The assumption is that it is possible to infer causes from consequences by inverting a probabilistic, correlational model, once it has been tuned to the hidden causal processes in the environment. You noted we haven't been able to algorithmatize that. An open research question?
