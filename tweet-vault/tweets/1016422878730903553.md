@mattsclancy @DianeCoyle1859 Matt, Thanks for telling me about your discussion group, it felt like fresh air in LA heat day. I noticed a comparison to CARD (for covariate selection) -- no comparison, CARD is a statistically driven routine, hence it cannot elevate us to
causal inference. Remember Cartwright.
