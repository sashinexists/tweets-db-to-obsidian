@aynumazi @yudapearl @AOC @deborahlipstadt @bellingcat This is only to say if she wants left-leaning dems like me to be part of a coalition to advocate Palestinian rights she can't be so reflexively disinterested in ensuring the Jewish state's sustainability. Which is basically her stance. And erodes trust.
