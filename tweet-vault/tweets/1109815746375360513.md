@Jabaluck @btshapir @yudapearl @diomavro It may be useful to think of settings where DAGs give us different conclusions than our usual Econ tool kit. E.g. a model with 2 endog variables and 2 instruments. This is “identified” in the sense we can estimate the structural parameters but not in the DAG sense
