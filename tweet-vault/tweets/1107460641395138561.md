@Jabaluck @yudapearl @Susan_Athey @joshgans What immediately comes it to mind is a re-analysis of AJR (2001) by Glynn and Rueda (https://t.co/PAUL3OnXPR). AJR is an old paper that has been criticized for many reasons, but not for this one, and the issue is broad. A DAG is not necessary to make the point but it does help.
