Not so. Not when two sides agree to a win/win sharing partnership. Besides, we have not heard this equation on Cinco de Mayo, last week. Reminds me of a parody I wrote on editors who feel the urge to spoil birthdays with  equations: https://t.co/F5H0tIioiE Happy Birthday Israel!! https://t.co/6yD0wUKsLQ
