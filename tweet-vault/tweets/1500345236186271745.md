@soboleffspaces @hemanth_kanak @ADAlthousePhD @PavlosMsaouel @GustafRydevik @stephensenn @f2harrell There are still questions about getting the ATE correctly, when the target population is shifting. In CI, we do it through do-calculus. How they do it in EBM, w/o math, is a puzzle to me. But I am open to learning, perhaps they are hiding a secret math that is much superior.
