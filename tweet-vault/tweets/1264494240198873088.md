@PHuenermund @conjugateprior @beyers_louw What are those "coefficients for Z"? Is that how the typical econ/management/social science folks talk? W/o distinguising outgoing from incoming? w/o distinguishing structural from partial regression coefficients? Why exclude readers like me who is trying to study how they talk?
