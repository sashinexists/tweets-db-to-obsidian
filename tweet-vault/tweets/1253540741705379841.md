@Jabaluck @autoregress @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @HeerJeet What's the point? Creative people can always find a link between the price of beans in China and traffic in LA. If they believe the link is strong, put an arrow and continue. If its weak enough to ignore, remove the arrow and continue. W&amp;C did the latter and failed to continue.
