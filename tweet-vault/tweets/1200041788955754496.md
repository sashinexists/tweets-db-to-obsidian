@EpiEllie @ConiByera @LucyStats @yudapearl @AlexaYakubovich @AnjaLeist @rohitpojha @AbbyCScience @_MiguelHernan @casualinfer The population difference in means can be zero (so there is no effect of X on the Y-mean), even though other features of the Y distribution are altered by X, e.g., the variance (so there is an effect of X on Y). With stochastic counterfactuals that can hold for every individual.
