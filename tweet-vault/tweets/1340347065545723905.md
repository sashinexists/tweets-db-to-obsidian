@yudapearl @steventberry @VC31415 I have no doubt that there are many econ problems covered by "SCM" and that it is advantageous at least sometimes.  But the usual way to argue for "always" rather than "sometimes" is to demonstrate it. Maybe all you mean to do is encourage this exploration. I'm in favor of that.
