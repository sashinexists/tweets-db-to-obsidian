I am not criticizing statistics for setting its boundaries narrowly. I am merely explicating how those boundaries were defined by its practices, textbooks and leaders. See quotes https://t.co/GsiZdmjnxS. If you want to widen those boundaries, fine; but admit it is a post-hoc job. https://t.co/lz4jE8knOm
