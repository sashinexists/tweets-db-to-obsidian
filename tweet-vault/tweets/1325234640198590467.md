Baruch Dayan Emet. Rabbi Sacks was a true pillar of wisdom and humanity for our generation. I had the fortune of meeting him in January and handing him a copy of #Bookofwhy. He told me something that I'd never forget: They'll follow you, if you're true to yourself.
I'll miss him. https://t.co/dehmXu15TJ
