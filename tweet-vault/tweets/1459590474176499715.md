@TaymAlsalti @DJMinded @havivrettiggur I would leave discussions about "fairness" to another occasions (we had many in the past). This thread deals with 2 issues:
1. Is it a fact that Palestinians see the elimination of Israel as the only acceptable, long term solution?
2. Why can't Westerners stomach this fact.
