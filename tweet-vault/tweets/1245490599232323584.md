@yudapearl @MarcioMinicz I'm not sure what a "domain" is. When Siri correctly understands my simple utterances, it is understanding me. But what is the domain? Siri has some narrow scope of competence. Causal models are required for answering causal questions. Do all domains involve causal questions?
