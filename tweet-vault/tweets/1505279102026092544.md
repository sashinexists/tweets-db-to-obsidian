@HL327 @artistexyz @stephensenn @soboleffspaces @ADAlthousePhD @JFronczekMD @EpiEllie @f2harrell @statsepi @GuyattGH @GRADE_WG If there is one thing I wish readers to take from #Bookofwhy, it is that RCT's and all their variants must be based on ATE, not the other way around. The latter is a stable property of reality, the former, man-made tricks that (occasionally) glimpse at reality.
