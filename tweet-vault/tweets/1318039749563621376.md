@TeresaWatanabe @Foodaism I was going to write to you too, but Rob is always ahead of me. Are you planning to follow up with a story on the 43 professors who wrote this Open Letter https://t.co/ISUPls1EHB ? That unprecedented Letter will have greater impact on campus life than the Rose-Tijani feud.
