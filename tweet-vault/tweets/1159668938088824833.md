@maximananyev @yudapearl @causalinf @steventberry @paulgp @lewbel @Undercoverhist Yes, I agree that DAGs -- or some well-specified structural model -- are helpful for thinking about external validity. Do you agree that "design" (in the sense that @yudapearl poo-poos) is also a key ingredient of identifying causal effects like that of schooling on earnings?
