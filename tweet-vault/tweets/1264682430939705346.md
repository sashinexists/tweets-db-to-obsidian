@yudapearl @fitelson Thank you, Professor. I’m currently taking a deep dive into causal inference (thanks in great part to your books) and I’m fascinated by the contrast (for lack of a beter word) between the computational, philosophical and even psychological (a la Jungs synchronicity) approaches.
