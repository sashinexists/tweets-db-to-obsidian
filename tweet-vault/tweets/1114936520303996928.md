@Jabaluck @autoregress @eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @juli_schuess @CarterPaddy Regarding your test. My view is that DAGs should be used in teaching, and in some papers and presentations. For this, we do not need to prove that epi is better econ, just that econ is better with DAGs than without, accounting for adoption costs.
