@subyroy @Valerie_Harper1 @kenaviba "Not to be silenced" of course, but to be ignored, like the Sathmar Rabbi who thinks Zionism sinfully hastens God's redemption, and like Bernie Sanders who thinks Jewish redemption lies in the evaporation of Israel.
The road to redemption is paved with false prophets.
