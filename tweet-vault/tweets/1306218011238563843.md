@PHuenermund @julianschuess @analisereal @nickchk @yudapearl The reason I think of this as a 'bias' is that I think nearly everyone would think of the estimand as the one you highlight, Y&lt;—f(yrs. school). So the other 'effect' is a biased estimate of *that* effect, the one in the audience's head. In brief, CATE ≠ ATE.
