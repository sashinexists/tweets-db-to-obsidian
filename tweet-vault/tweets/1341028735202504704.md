@yudapearl @JaapAbbring @Chris_Auld @DonskerClass @lewbel @PhilHaile @steventberry Economic models (fully specified) can answer all sorts of CF queries. Causality is automatic in these models. Agnostics are skeptical about that and try to answer more limited CF questions without imposing  heavy structure. Eg compare papers by Pat Bajari to Angrist papers.
