@steventberry @causalinf @Chris_Auld @lewbel @PHuenermund @econbookclub @analisereal @jdramirezc @PhilHaile My statement is about the definition of a counterfactual.
If you agree with my definition, and the 3-step procedure, than we agree on all the rest. However, this definition invokes (step-2) shutting off equations to which Heckman objects vehemently. So where are we? In agreement?
