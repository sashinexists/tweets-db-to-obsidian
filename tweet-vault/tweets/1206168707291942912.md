@RonKenett @AndreaSaltelli @fhuszar Pearl has this habit of celebrating what we can do today that we could not do yesterday. Ron has the habit of playing Solomon the wise: "Nothing is new under the sun"  relevant or not. I'd go with Pearl; celebrations are fun and yield new results. Solomon doesn't #Bookofwhy
