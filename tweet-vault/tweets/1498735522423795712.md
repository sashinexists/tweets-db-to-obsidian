@PavlosMsaouel @StableMarkets @RWJE_BA @stephensenn @ESMDcan123 @f2harrell @eliasbareinboim I have difficulties seeing what those "design nuances" are, awaiting description in the form of a "research question", i.e., what is given, what question we wish to answer, what are the methodological options. Can we see a tweetable example w/o links to jargon-laden papers?
