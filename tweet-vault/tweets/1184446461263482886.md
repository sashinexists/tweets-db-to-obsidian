@f2harrell @stephensenn @goodmanmetrics @JadePinkSameera @ShannonBrownlee @Lester_Domes @vamrhein @dailyzad @METRICStanford @learnfromerror @MariaGlymour @CMichaelGibson @PTetlock @hmkyale @_MiguelHernan Fair enough.

Improvements, if any, are inferred from {data+qualitative assumptions}, not assumed.
