@conjugateprior @yudapearl @beyers_louw Yes, that's right. Our starting point is the typical econ/management/social science research setting with one (main) hypothesis about X â€”&gt; Y. The estimated coefficients for Z are then often interpreted as an afterthought. We argue that this is potentially misleading.
