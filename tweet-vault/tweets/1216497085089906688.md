@suchisaria @RandomlyWalking @raamana_ I like your distinctions, for they are cast in terms of the questions we aim to answer, rather than the mathematics used to answer them. I hope they bring DL students to realize: "Gee! We never dealt with questions which we could not answer! The world IS 3-dimensional" @Bookofwhy
