@alexdamour @eliasbareinboim @CsabaSzepesvari @mendel_random I agree with Elias. One of the most common questions I get from students and newcomers is: What are the strengths &amp; limitations of each notation system &amp; how do we combine them? The answers are not entirely subjective, but the objective component is lost once people get annoyed.
