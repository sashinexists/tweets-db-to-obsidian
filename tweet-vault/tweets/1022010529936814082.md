@PHuenermund @vhranger Thanks, Paul. But, to escape charges of bias, I would not state a problem in graphical terms. The problem is Eco. 101. You take ANY economic model and ANY parameter BETA in the model, and you ask an innocent question: Can BETA be estimated using OLS with ANY control whatsoever?
