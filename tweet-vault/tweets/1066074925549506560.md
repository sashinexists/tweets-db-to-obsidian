@yudapearl @eliasbareinboim @jasonhartford @zacharylipton @CsabaSzepesvari @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @ShalitUri That seems reverse, no? I feel strange to be the one arguing for Google. However, to raise any kind of funding or awareness like that requires at least preliminary evidence of some success in applications. If those are convincing, I'd be happy to ask!
