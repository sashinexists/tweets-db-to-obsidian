@tdietterich @eliasbareinboim That's not the point. All Centers brag: "We also do CI." Yet there is still not one Center for Causal  Science where CI is declared THE focus of research and education and that generates a fraction of the number of data-centric PhD's that a typical DATA SCIENCE CENTER graduates.
