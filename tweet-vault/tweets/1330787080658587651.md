@thefeministcop @EinatWilf Glad you are exploring Zionism by asking a Zionist, not a BDS propagandist. A "Jewish state" means a national homeland for the Jewish people, same as a national homeland for the Palestinian people (recall, majority of Israeli's are atheist -- it's peoplehood that makes us Jewish)
