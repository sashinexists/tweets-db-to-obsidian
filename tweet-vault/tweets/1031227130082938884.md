@eliasbareinboim @analisereal @yudapearl @maya_sen The point would be something like we call multiple things "race" - self-identification, others' perceptions, physiological features. Those things might each have effects but it's not meaningful to talk effects of "race" because the label is ambiguous, thus the cause ill-defined.
