@f2harrell @yudapearl @RonKenett @learnfromerror In general a blocking factor is chosen because a) it is considered predictive and b) it is practical to block. For single dose trials in asthma 'patient' is perfect. You run a cross-over trial &amp; all genetic &amp; environmental factors are controlled for. Its not possible in cancer.
