@soboleffspaces @stephensenn @AndrewPGrieve @PavlosMsaouel @f2harrell @smueller @ChristosArgyrop @Genstat Not me, sorry. Because, based on 60 yrs experience, I can predict the result: Reading papers on causation written in the standard language of statistics would end up a waist of time and a painful disappointment. Even the concept of "confounding" would not be defined.
