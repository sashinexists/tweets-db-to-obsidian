I had  to pacify a reviewer's demand to remove the reference to Babylon, possibly to protect the honor of ML. I truly recommend Toulmin's "Foresight and Understanding" (1961). Published papers must compromise to the lowest denominator. Hoping #BookOfWhy will see an uprising. https://t.co/hF5wDcCbV3
