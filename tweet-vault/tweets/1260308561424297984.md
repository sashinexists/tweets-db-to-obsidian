@JakeVigdor @causalinf @GivingTools @KetchupEconomi1 @sterndavidi Now I understand where the notion of "pay to publish" comes from. Unheard of in my corner. And let's not forget the "cite to publish" industry. That's how some journals become "high impact": The more you cite the guru, the higher your chances of a favorable review.
