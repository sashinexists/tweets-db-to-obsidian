@yudapearl @btselem @hrw "imperfections" is a bad euphemism for violations of human rights and international law. Your idea that Israel is committed to 2 homelands is contradicted by Likud charter &amp; explicit statements of Ben Gurion &amp; leaders ever since about plans for Eretz Israel. What "two homelands"?
