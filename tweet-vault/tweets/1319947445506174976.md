#Sudan to normalize relations with Israel!!! Pundits will soon analyze the strategic/economic implications of this deal but, to Israelis, Sudan is also symbolic of the "Three NO's" Resolution (Khartum, 1967)-- the 1st knife in the back of our peace camp. Time to reassess symbols? https://t.co/0Gya8gMg3g
