@yudapearl @AndrewYNg I think @AndrewYNg is advocating for an operational shift from engineering code to engineering datasets, vs. any epistemological shift. Better data quality would benefit both causal and non-causal views of #ML. 

Are you saying that data-centric=causal, model-centric=non-causal?
