@IvanWerning @steventberry @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @yudapearl @MariaGlymour @autoregress I think this special case is extremely helpful and if we didn't use reduced form to refer to that we would need some other term. And I can see how the more general analogue might be useful for other estimation strategies besides IV.
