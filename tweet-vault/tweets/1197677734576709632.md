@JessGeraldYoung @AdanZBecerra1 @epidetective @sherrirose @_MiguelHernan @yudapearl @EpiEllie @stephensenn @jon_y_huang @JadePinkSameera @mats_julius Thanks for the papers. Are you willing to share an intuition for this approach? Reading the abstracts, im not sure how much I could translate these effects in my own messy observational data. A problem w all of these effects but I wonder if assumptions here are more stringent.
