@PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @yudapearl @MariaGlymour @autoregress That is one subset of good design. More broadly, I mean what economists refer to as finding an identification strategy (in contrast to how @yudapearl uses the term). This means deciding what tDAG will be used to identify the causal effect.
