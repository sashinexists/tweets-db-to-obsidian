Too bad I did not have this paper when asked (in an interview): "Any real-life problems solved by DAGs?" All I said was: "In my corner of the wood, one generic toy-problem is worth 100 messy "real life" problems". Now I can cite &gt;200 papers to pacify the Gods of messiness. https://t.co/ixBxjqlmMA
