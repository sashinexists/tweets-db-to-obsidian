Hard to understand how organizations like @hrw @KenRoth and @BDS can continue to pose as
"merely opposing policies." If they're not aiming for Israel destruction, they could easily say so explicitly: 
"2-states, equally legitimate and equally indigenous."
Why haven't they? Why? https://t.co/CnvFWqzUIH
