@yudapearl @iwashyna @Amy_Bohnert @Research_ICU @NEJM Target trials are a nice way for those familiar w/ experimental design to get comfortable with observational causal inference. It can help avoid problems for observational studies like immortal time bias, inappropriate comparators (b/c confounding, colliders &amp;or generalizability)
