@yudapearl @PHuenermund @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal I'm the one telling economists that DAGs could be a very useful tool for a variety of questions. But you speak from a position of ignorance. You have little idea what quasi-experimentalists do in practice or why since you refuse to read their papers.
