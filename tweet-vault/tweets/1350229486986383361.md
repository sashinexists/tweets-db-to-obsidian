@questionsin2014 @ShaiDeLuca @marclamonthill @deliveries_i @ClaireRedacted @ShorrTirza @Donald191 @MJPlitnick My My!! "Stigmatized any critique of Israeli occupation"!! How inconsiderate!! That is why I am only using Zionophobia, no stigma. No true Zionophobe has ever complained for being "stigmatized" as such. They take it as a badge of honor.
