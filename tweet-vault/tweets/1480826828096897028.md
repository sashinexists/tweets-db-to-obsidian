@HanaBalshin @sullydish @BDYemini @YKleinHalevi To be honest about Israel's wrongdoings, and to write about it with some credibility, you need to do more than just join the many packs of howling hounds. You need to also call out the Industry of Lies. This is what @jstreetu, @InfNotNow, @NewIsralFund, @sullydish rarely do.
