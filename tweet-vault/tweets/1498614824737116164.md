@casualinfer @EpiEllie @LucyStats @yudapearl @AmJEpi Fascinating! Its always great to "listen" to @yudapearl. Both of you, the hosts - well conducted conversation! Its good when he doesn't have to start each time with PO/do-calculus/DAGs - you picked up nicely from his intro on personalized medicine. Great conversation!
