@autoregress @PHuenermund @Jabaluck @pablogerbas @juli_schuess @fuzzydunlop123 @MariaGlymour @EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer @metrics52 @eliasbareinboim Before Galileo pointed his telescope towards the moon, he tried it on a tree, 2 km away, and saw nothing new, just the familiar old tree, but smiling in freshness.
