@pierre_rochard @dopamine_uptake @TheStalwart @nic__carter @WhiteRabbitBTC @100trillionUSD @coinmetrics I am yet to find a signal that a certain "correlation is not spurious" which is not based on causal assumptions. So, has any of its advocates been able to explicate those causal assumptions? I know that Granger was not able, see https://t.co/0GEymbQcZW Who was? #Bookofwhy
