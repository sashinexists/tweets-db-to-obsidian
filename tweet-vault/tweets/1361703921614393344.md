@dmckenzie001 @jenniferdoleac @PHuenermund @causalinf I like your survey of the confusion in the matching arena, but not the "Bottom line of all of these cases is the need to really understand the context well," which sounds like pre-scientific calls to "think hard." Today, "understanding the context" has been mathematized.
