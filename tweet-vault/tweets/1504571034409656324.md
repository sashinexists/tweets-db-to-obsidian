@federicarusso @dylanarmbruste3 @yudapearl @causalinf @Jon_Williamson_ Epistemic? What exactly is epistemic about saying we need evidential pluralism for causal claims? Compare this with Pearl's causal epistemology, which provides the vocabulary, grammar, and calculus for moving from associational to counterfactual queries in causal inferences.üëáüèª https://t.co/9RlOVPXb25
