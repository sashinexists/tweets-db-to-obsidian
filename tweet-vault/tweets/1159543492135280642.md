@fuzzydunlop123 @steventberry @yudapearl @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @MariaGlymour @autoregress My experience at Yale is the opposite: students' first instinct is to write down a structural model, but they have less experience finding good research designs in the Mostly Harmless sense. Of course, the best students are very capable of doing both well!
