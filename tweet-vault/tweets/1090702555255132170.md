@f2harrell @yudapearl There are forms of knowledge that you wouldn't normally use priors over parameters for - like priors about causal structure.
But you could still (with a bit of gymnastics) encode it as uncertainty over models, thereby using a parameterization. 
Are there cases that can't be done?
