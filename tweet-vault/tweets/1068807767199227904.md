@eliasbareinboim @alexdamour @yudapearl @mendel_random Honest question: So is it true or not that ignorability means the the actual DAG belongs to a particular set of DAGs? If this is true, I would test each DAG one by one in the set. My test fails if all tests fail: A valid test, though not good on power. Do I miss something?
