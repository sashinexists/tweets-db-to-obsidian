There are (at least) two inaccuracies in this paper:(1) Nonparametric SEM does not assume error-independence (see&lt;--&gt;) therefore, no one should use the acronym NPSEM-IE. (2) NPSEM does NOT assume that all variables (V ) can be intervened on. See https://t.co/z89XWA0OdR #Bookofwhy https://t.co/U8WCysVtDB
