@causalinf @Nichogachet @pedrohcgs @lewbel @instrumenthull @BruceEHansen One can start with a PO setting and show how, under unconfoundedness, one can obtain a conditional expectation in observable variables: E(Y|W,X). It's not much, but I added sections to Chs 3 and 7 of my intro book to make this connection. There's still work to do after that.
