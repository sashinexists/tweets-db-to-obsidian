@ADAlthousePhD @f2harrell @stephensenn @soboleffspaces @SMuellerLab You seem very impatient with me. Sorry. I perfectly understand the intuition in your example, but I am asking for a formal criterion that makes A and B more comparable than A and O. Why formal? Because once you put it down formally you would discover some "holes" in thinking.
