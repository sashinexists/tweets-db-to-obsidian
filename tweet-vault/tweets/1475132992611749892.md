What She (@lsarsour) meant is obvious: "We (Palestinians) are determined to deny any Jewish connection to the history of the Holy Land, so as to make ignorant people believe we are indigenous and they are NOT." I've challenged her to say the words "equally indigenous"- she can't! https://t.co/KiUFKh7Wz5
