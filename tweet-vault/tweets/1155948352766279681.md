@Jabaluck @erinhengel @PHuenermund @yudapearl again, we're talking about employment after treatment (i.e after the decision to get/not get insurance)- otherwise it's not post-treatment. A causal path from 
poverty to treatment can not possibly pass through a variable that measures something that happened after the treatment.
