@a40ruhr @snavarrol @causalinf @PossebomVitor @Jabaluck @nickchk Not surprised. The "giants" refuse to accept that even straightforward judgments, such as exogeneity or exclusion", come from a mental model that, once explicated, regardless how sketchily, would make judgments so much more reliable. No, "more credible" says the flag. #Bookofwhy
