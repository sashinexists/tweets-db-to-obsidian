@mendel_random @adamkvonende I've enjoyed, and have learned from the history of the "personalized treatment" aspiration, and was waiting for the punch line: "Now we know better ... Now we know when and how it can be achieved or approximated..." That is why I was expecting a causal model for guidance.
