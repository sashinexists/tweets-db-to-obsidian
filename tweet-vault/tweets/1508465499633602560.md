@dylanarmbruste3 @noah_greifer @soboleffspaces @yudapearl @causalinf @EpiEllie @bveg3 The major of your concerns are false... Random confounding is a problem in obs data, not from a RCT. Lack of adherence and generalization is less problem in experimental data due to random allocation. In obs. studies you need much much more assumptions from causal perspective.
