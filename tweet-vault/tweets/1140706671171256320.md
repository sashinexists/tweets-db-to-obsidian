1/2 Yours is a very encouraging perspective of modern SEM, namely, SEM = "SCM that accommodates parametric assumptions." Its badly needed. I am familiar with the linear and nonparametric ends of the spectrum; are there any powerful results in between? Say binary, or monotonic?. https://t.co/dNM3sFngkF
