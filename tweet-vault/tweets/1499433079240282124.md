@stephensenn @yudapearl @f2harrell @soboleffspaces @SMuellerLab And frankly, it’s also silly to be the one telling “RCT experts” that your work changes how we ought to do things but first insisting that the RCT experts need to translate all of their “terminology” and “notation” into *your* preferred framework to have a conversation with you.
