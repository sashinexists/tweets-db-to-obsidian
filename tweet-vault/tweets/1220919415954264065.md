@joe_shipman @nntaleb @HarryDCrane No offense, but I can tell you are statistician. How? For my stat colleagues things has "meaning" only if they can be expressed in the language of statistics. Causal questions cannot be expressed thus, and I presume this is what is so frustrating to @nntaleb and @HarryDCrane.
