@atypical_me @KordingLab @dan_marinazzo Say you observed data &amp; DCM spit out A→B;
what could a future experiment look like allowing me to either falsify your statement/theory "A→B" or to find my observations compatible with your theory?

Does "A→B" as per DCM have falsifiability/refutability? https://t.co/telgpsxJP5
