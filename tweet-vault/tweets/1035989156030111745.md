@KordingLab @MariaGlymour @alex__morley @dan_marinazzo What in the pre-causal days were called "causal insights"  are today "causal assumptions", expressed in some formal model. If you know of a "causal insight" that has not yet been captured by SCM,  let us know, and the next PhD project in my lab will be to capture it. #Bookofwhy
