@JaapAbbring @yudapearl @Chris_Auld @DonskerClass @lewbel @PhilHaile @steventberry (key measurement equations were derived from SIR with testing). But, as a reminder, Philip Wright used DAGs for equilibrium analysis, and I would like to see this more fully developed. DAG folks seem to take that as a criticism, but it is not. A wish.
