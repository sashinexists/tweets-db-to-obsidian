@soboleffspaces @AndrewPGrieve @stephensenn @PavlosMsaouel @f2harrell @smueller @ChristosArgyrop This is my difficulty too in reading DOE literature. It speaks "effects" "influence" "blocking" "cause" "covariation" but has no math language to express these relationships and their nuances, save for the language of covariation -- all causal considerations are done in the mind.
