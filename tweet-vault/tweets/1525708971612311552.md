One quote of @GloriaSteinem strongly resonates in my ears: 
"Feminism includes all women. Or it isn't feminism."
It reaffirms my conclusion that Linda Sarsour (and other Women's March leaders) are fake feminists https://t.co/2nCKQxaZHX
cannily excluding Zionist and Israeli women. https://t.co/NIenMiJzGN
