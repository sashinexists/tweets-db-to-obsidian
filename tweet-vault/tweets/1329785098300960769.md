@AndersHuitfeldt @yudapearl @PHuenermund Yep - there's a BIG gap between solving a problem theoretically &amp; resolving the same problem in practice. It's like saying confounding is 'solved' by DAGs. In practice, people don't know how to draw good DAGs, &amp; regardless will still have missing or poorly measured variables.
