@mattshomepage @tdietterich @TacoCohen Same happened to me. First excitement, then disappointment and then a much greater excitement: a proof that you MUST have a DAG, or, better yet, that you can figure out what is the minimal thing you must assume before you can get an answer to your question. No longer disappointed
