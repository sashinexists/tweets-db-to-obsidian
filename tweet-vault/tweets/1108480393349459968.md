@akelleh @eprosenthal @EvanBianco Great name "Causal Data Science" and great blog too. How do you survive Columbia under such name? Last time I spoke at Columbia they almost crucified me at the podium for suggesting they should name their Institute "Reality Science" instead of "Data Science" #Bookofwhy
