Good question. In theory, anti-Zionism is the same as #Zionophobia. The difference lies in the connotation. The former connotes a principled ideology (eg anti-Tax-loopholes) the latter connotes a moral pathology which rhymes with #Islamophobia reflects its irrational obsession. https://t.co/iGVWofPDc0
