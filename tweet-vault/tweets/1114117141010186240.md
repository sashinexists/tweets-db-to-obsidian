@Jabaluck @KordingLab @yudapearl @maximananyev @PHuenermund Definitely worth exploring this point.  I don’t think “stats is insular” is a good explanation either.  There are pockets of (loud) resistance to DAGs and the SCM in stats, but that doesn’t drive anything.  Your theory (benefits of DAGs may work in existing methods) makes sense.
