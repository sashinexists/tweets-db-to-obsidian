@eliasbareinboim @artistexyz @yudapearl @johnmark_taylor @ylecun @GaryMarcus I only wish @yudapearl would switch from fighting AI establishment to spreading causal epistemology to specialists working in their fields. It's impossible to convince algorithmicists believing in data, or megalomaniacs in possession of a God complex and 3B-parameter models. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
