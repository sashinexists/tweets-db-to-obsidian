@robertwplatt @rohitpojha @EpiEllie @AbbyCScience @Lester_Domes @_MiguelHernan @casualinfer I cannot work through these question in the TT framework, because no one would tell me whether TT constrains me, and how. Perhaps someone versed in TT can do it and tell us if there is anything wrong in assuming no constraints. IOW TT permits us to forget about TT. #Bookofwhy
