@GSCollins @statsmethods @PWGTennant @yudapearl My impression is that the number of protocols that mention multiple imputation is increasing. Certainly partly due to reporting guidelines like @TRIPODStatement. Yes, no mentioning = red flag, but so is imputation without further consideration (aka brainless imputation)
