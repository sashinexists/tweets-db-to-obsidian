Agree with @GaryMarcus on the insufficiency of causal inference. But the "type-token distinction" is IMHO well formalized in structural models as "unit level vs. population level distinction" (Causality p. 310). The firing-squad example in #Bookofwhy shows token counterfactuals. https://t.co/cqZpd7ksQ2
