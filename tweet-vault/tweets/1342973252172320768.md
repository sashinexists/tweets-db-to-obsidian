@ShalitUri @VC31415 @CasualBrady @yudapearl It is also important to clarify overlap conditions for the educational purpose to popularize causal DAGs. There is an unfair criticism of causal DAGs saying that DAGs can handle non-interventionable targets. But Pearl never said it since the joint positivity excludes that case.
