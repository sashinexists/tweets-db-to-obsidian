@autoregress @analisereal @Jabaluck @gelbach @HeerJeet How can you say that Pearl ignore monotonicity? See my discussion on monotonicity with Imbens https://t.co/sZPpL7Ifmg. Not only can SCM articulate monotonicity when it is plausible, but we can also test it when it is in doubt (See Causality). We do not shun tools, we use them.
