Moving on... next up is front door adjustment. This is a neat little trick that can help estimate P(Y|do(x)) when there is an unmeasured confounder for X &amp; Y but an unconfounded mediator. Iâ€™m not convinced that this scenario is all that likely in the real world, though. https://t.co/v7OPQD0UXv
