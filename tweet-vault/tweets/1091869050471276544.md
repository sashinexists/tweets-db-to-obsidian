@learnfromerror @elementary_peng @richardtomsett At leaset people who eat "hot dogs" agree on what "dogs" are. Do Bayesians agree on "who is Bayesian"? I gave a humorous definition: "assigning priors to parameters." Do we have a more technical definition that would satisfy the high priests? #Bookofwhy
