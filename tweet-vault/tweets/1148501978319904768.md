@yudapearl @fuzzydunlop123 @autoregress @MariaGlymour @PHuenermund @EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer @metrics52 I claim that, with the exception of some relatively rare complex cases, good work by "X-econs" gets these issues right. I include the above paper as an example. If you read it, especially Section 3, you will see how economists handle these issues.
