@charleskfisher @NikosNi41644559 I am relieved. So, a CNN used in my kitchen would have the same "inductive bias" as the one used in my backyard. This is what I suspected, uniformity over problem instances. Not so "model-based" inference. Each problem demands its own model to start the inference engine going.
