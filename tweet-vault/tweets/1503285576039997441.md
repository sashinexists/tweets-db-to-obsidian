@jmwooldridge @causalinf @Nichogachet @pedrohcgs @lewbel @instrumenthull @BruceEHansen I thought the question was about the bridge between "classic" econometrics and PO. I do not see the former in your proposal. Moreover, don't you agree that the work you hope to do is already done by the First Law? https://t.co/etASSEk4Or. If not, what part of it is missing?
