@conjugateprior @a_strezh @instrumenthull @PHuenermund @paulgp @dlmillimet @pietrobiroli @DAGophile Another clear and thoughtful paper on race and discrimination, resisting manipulativity. The conclusions are too cautious, in my opinion.
I've hard time thinking of any case where race is  understood at all, be it formally or conceptually, and where it cannot be modeled causally.
