@yudapearl @PACESconsulting @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @Jabaluck @HeerJeet You have a non-parametric solution to sample selection that doesn't boil down to a CMAR assumption or identification-at-infinity (both very familiar to economists, including Heckman when he wrote that paper)? If so I'd be very interested to hear. Not sarcasm.
