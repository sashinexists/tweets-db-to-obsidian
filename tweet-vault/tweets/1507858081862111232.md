@yudapearl @noah_greifer @soboleffspaces @causalinf @EpiEllie @bveg3 @Lizstuartdc Ok. But even at that level of analysis, chaotic [deterministic] systems with macroscopically identical initial conditions can yield significantly different outcomes.

Is it not reasonable to ask whether Y(x, u) should be treated as a stochastic variable when u is a human being?
