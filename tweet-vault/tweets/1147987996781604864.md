@vijayant_k @Canadian_JACD @EpiEllie @_MiguelHernan According to all experts I talk to, BP is not just an indicator of some risk factor, but it actually causing  bad things, eg. heart stress. We do not want to go to extremes and claim that we are only seeing the display on the measuring device, not the BP itself. #Bookofwhy
