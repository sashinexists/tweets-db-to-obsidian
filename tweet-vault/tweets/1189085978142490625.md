@matsouaka @LauraBBalzer @eliasbareinboim @Megtron9 @Lizstuartdc @leskocar @EpidByDesign @_MiguelHernan @Carthica @herbps10 @LeontineAlkema Trying to advise readers who have spent many hours studying classical transportability (eg https://t.co/1i3MyL3lUb). Would they be able to solve new problems after spending many more hours on Issa et al ? Or is it the same set of problems? Perhaps weaker assumptions? #Bookofwhy
