@cdsamii @eliasbareinboim @deaneckles @yudapearl Pearl 2001 ("Direct and Indirect Effects") argues that (gender) discrimination is indeed such a direct effect, but actually the "natural" direct effect; you seem to refer to the CDE. But then we agree? To define discrimination, we need to state that gender is a cause.
