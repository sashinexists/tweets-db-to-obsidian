@yudapearl @stephensenn @PavlosMsaouel @ESteyerberg @LinkedIn @Lester_Domes @MariaGlymour @NP_Jewell @XiaoLiMeng1 Yes I saw your reasons. Regarding clustering as forbidden word since "experimental"

Are you familiar with complex survey designs which aren't experiments but have to deal with clustering? Hence it's not just an experimental thing.
