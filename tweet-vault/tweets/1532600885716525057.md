I don't see why one must be #antisemitic to be dangerous, repulsive and stupid. Suppose this image points exclusively to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and blood-libels never existed in Jewish history, shouldn't everyone  be appalled by this  image? Shouldn't #ADL condemn it? https://t.co/woYMNaY0JZ
