@yudapearl @RonKenett @learnfromerror 1/2) It’s both. If you decide that sex is an important determinant of outcome you probably feel that it’s a factor that should be included in your model. By including you will eliminate the effect of sex from the estimate and it’s estimated standard error, which is appropriate.
