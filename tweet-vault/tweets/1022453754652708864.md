I still don't get it.  Pr(Y|do(x)) is about as different from Pr(Y^x) as dy/dx is from f'(x). They are just different notations for the same thing. I am sure Leibniz and Newton would have subtle arguments for their own notation, but it is not going to settle the priority question https://t.co/SnsHVOH0lJ
