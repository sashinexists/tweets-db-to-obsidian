I find it morally deranged, and divinely hypocritical for anyone concerned with children's lives to ignore the bleeding and suffering of 300,000 Israeli children under 20 yrs of Hamas rockets. It is doubly depressing to see this hypocrisy in journalism, my son's noble profession. https://t.co/VzllMk5zy1
