@bgoncalves @yudapearl I once had a great conversation about causation and other topics with Professor Pearl at UCLA (IPAM).  I am a huge fan!  As I explain in my paper, I really like the way he discusses Simpson's Paradox (I just think that there are other, relevant non-causal confusions involved).
