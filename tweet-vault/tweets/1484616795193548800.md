@yudapearl @ingorohlfing @causalinf @soboleffspaces @EpiEllie @nickchk Exactly. He allows for a change in a variable or its distribution. But those are very different things. (Using some single-case interpretation of prob. both could be at the individual level, I suppose, but I'm not sure that's what he has in mind.)
