@rlmcelreath @analisereal @yudapearl Why you are controlling for Z?  If you know that Z has no effect, then controlling for Z will affect the precision in the estimate of the X to Y effect.  But you may be wrong. Measuring and testing zero paths tell you more about the validity of the model than the specified paths.
