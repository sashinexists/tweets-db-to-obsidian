I owe my life to the Balfour Declaration. If it were not for Balfour, my father would not have been able to leave pogrom-infected Europe (1923) and build my home town, near Tel Aviv, and my mother would not have been able to escape holocaust-bound Poland 1935 and have baby me. https://t.co/FUB6VQmtqy
