1/2 I am saying that the causal story behind the data determines which statistician is correct, and that the story should be articulated in the language of diagrams (not as Rubin and Holland told it). Thus, if we believe that diagram 3 is what Wainer etal meant, we go to diag 3. https://t.co/NUZIfZB1fc
