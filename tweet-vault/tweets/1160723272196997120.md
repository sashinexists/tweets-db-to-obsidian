@yudapearl @autoregress @steventberry @MariaGlymour @Jabaluck @IvanWerning @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas Often very useful in applied work.  e.g., if Z is a policy instrumenting a `treatment' X in turn causing outcome Y, the RF for Y tells us the direct effect of the policy on the outcome.  Can you explain why you think this *isn't* a useful concept?
