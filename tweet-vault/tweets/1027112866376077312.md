@malco_barrett @NeuroStats @l__ds @ken_rothman @EpiEllie Agree. The role that Rothman's PIE plays in causal modelling is simple: You zoom in on any family in the DAG and, if the function Child = f(Parents) is Boolean, you can give it visual description, called Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF). But are
