@garybkatz @RozRothstein @USCAlumni @CampusFairness @StandWithUs @USC Not so! Universities are already catering to Qatar to replace Jewish philanthropy. What they still cannot do is replace Jewish professors with Qatari professors; that is why they are hoping that the former would be fooled by empty words of "fighting antisemitism".
