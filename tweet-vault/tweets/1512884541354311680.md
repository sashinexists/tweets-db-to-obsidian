@yudapearl Exactly my point - no difference. The RCT literature even recognizes covariate adjustment as "correcting for empirical confounding"👇🏻
But before getting P(z), one has to decide what Z should be in the adjustment set, right? Observational studies use DAGs for this, why not RCTs? https://t.co/5mVbebMo5I
