Very interesting. Unfortunately, the notation makes it hard for me to see if it is related to the instrumental inequality ( Causality, p. 274) which is a testable condition for the classical IV structure. Conditioned on X we have a classical IV structure. https://t.co/p2bUGoVKbx https://t.co/luWvFhHVbb
