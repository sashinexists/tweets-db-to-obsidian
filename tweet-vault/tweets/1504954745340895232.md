@soboleffspaces @ADAlthousePhD @artistexyz @stephensenn @HL327 @JFronczekMD @EpiEllie @f2harrell @statsepi @GuyattGH @GRADE_WG I believe I have done it for RCT as well, but it was a terrible mistake, never tell a proud profession what you think they are trying to do, let them articulate it themselves; we will soon be hearing from trialists, in one formula, what it is that RCT is aiming to estimate.
