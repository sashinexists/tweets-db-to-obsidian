@AdaptiveAgents @djinnome @AgEconomist @causalinf @analisereal @chuston1776 @eliasbareinboim @DeepMind I believe the discussion will be illuminated if we gain a common understanding of what "probabilistic program" (PP) is. Am I right to assume that PP takes an arbitrary set S of probabilistic expressions and outputs the tightest bound on any desired expression E implied by S.  ???
