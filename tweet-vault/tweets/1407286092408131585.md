@DJonahue @testy_joebob @SarahKSilverman @ZionessMovement Request for good people who support Israel's existence but not its "expansionism". To help us distinguish you from the many imposters around, kindly supplement your objections to perceived manifestations of the latter with a screaming outrage at any denial of the former. Deal?
