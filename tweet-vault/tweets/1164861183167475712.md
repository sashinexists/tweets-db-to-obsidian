@yudapearl @AdanZBecerra1 @jon_y_huang @WATZILEI @ecpolley The word "model" is being used to mean two different things here. Double robustness offers protection against misspecification in the statistical model - i.e. protection from using wrong functional forms of covariates. It offers no protection against misspecification of the DAG.
