@EpiEllie @AndersHuitfeldt @PHuenermund @causalinf @HenningStrandin @soboleffspaces @nickchk The notational distinction represents an important substantive distinction: Those lucky PO expressions that can be written as do-expression represent causal quantities that are estimable from experimental studies.
