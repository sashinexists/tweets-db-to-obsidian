@sean_a_mcclure @HarryDCrane The opaque culture you prefer reminds me of Babylonian astronomy in Toulmin's "Forecast and Understanding" (see   https://t.co/KxIOCDc7nM, last page) It may get us to Babylon, but not to Athens; I prefer the footsteps of Eratosthenes and measure the turtle's radius  #Bookofwhy
