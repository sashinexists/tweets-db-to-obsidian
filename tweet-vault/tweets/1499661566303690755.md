@statsepi @PWGTennant @yudapearl @ADAlthousePhD @stephensenn @f2harrell @soboleffspaces @SMuellerLab The bigger issue to me seems to be not when methodologists don't know the specifics of a specialist area (how can they for all that matter?) but rather when a fundamental challenge posed by that area to the methodology is ignored.
