@VC31415 @CasualBrady Slide is from my course, where I teach PO and then causal graphs, and I explain to students why in PO we talked a lot about overlap but then in CG it kinda disappeared.
Basically my intention was to explain why I think stat-causal cares a lot about overlap whereas CG does not.
