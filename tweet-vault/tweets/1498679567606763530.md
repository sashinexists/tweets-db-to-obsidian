@RWJE_BA @yudapearl @PavlosMsaouel @stephensenn @ESMDcan123 @f2harrell @eliasbareinboim I agree that's why I said *If* ID assumptions hold. NP Bayes is not a causal method. It's just a flexible inference engine. "Interpretability" has many meanings, but in general I'd prefer a flexible model rather than simple models that are very likely wrong.
