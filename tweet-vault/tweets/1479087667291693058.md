@zaffama @tdietterich @BomNaKub @roydanroy The expression "had I not take aspirin" means "ceteris paribus", namely, everything else remaining unaltered, my medical history, my chronic migraine, including my urge to take aspirin each time I have a headache. And this is what Y_x' represents, as defined in the First Law.
