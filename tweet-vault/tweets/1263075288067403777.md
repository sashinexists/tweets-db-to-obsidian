@karlrohe @omaclaren Simpson's paradox is in the disputed territory between CI and Statistics. Discovered by the latter and resolved by the former.  The part of CI that resolved Simpson's paradox is in AI; statisticians are still perplexed. See  https://t.co/GpSKmVcKR7 and the discussion around it.
