The title "statistical discrimination" worries me, because "discrimination" is a causal, not statistical notion. The words "from economics" makes me doubly worried, for reasons explained in #Bookofwhy. But I would love to hear how statisticians define "fairness". Truly curious. https://t.co/9xkC3EQ0f6
