@NP_Jewell and other statisticians of good standing. Can anyone see a problem with: "each student eats in one of the two dining halls, and each of these two dining halls serves one diet, different from the other." I am told statisticians would see here complications -- I don't. https://t.co/Khizfy6GrR
