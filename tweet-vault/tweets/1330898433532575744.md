@zeemo_n @thefeministcop @Shade_Nox @EinatWilf It's not who was there first that counts. What matters is who's maintained historical, cultural and linguistic connection to it. The Palestinians call it "narrative", and they are trying very very hard to create one. They understand that a "narrative" is a trust deed to a land.
