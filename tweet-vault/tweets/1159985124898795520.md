@Jabaluck @alexpghayes @steventberry @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @yudapearl @MariaGlymour @autoregress here is an example of something Iâ€™m teaching how to model at the moment: a chemical reaction occurs where substrate S is converted to product P. It does this by first reversibly binding with an enzyme E to form a complex C. Product step is C goes to P + E. How would you model?
