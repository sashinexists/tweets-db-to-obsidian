@DKedmey @DavidDeutschOxf It would be interesting to try this criterion on a causal model, bc such models provide miniature laboratories for "scientific state of understanding". But we need to further explicate what "hard to vary" means; who is doing the "varying" etc. Perhaps @DavidDeutschOxf can help.
