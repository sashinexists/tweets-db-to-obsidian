Thanks, David, for resurrecting this video. It's amazing how little has changed on campus. With two exceptions: (1) BDS got much bolder, they no longer hide their eliminationist agenda, and (2) Bruins for Israel is much stronger (within Hillel), they fight Zionophobia directly. https://t.co/X6yQnqWnV7
