Today is #JerusalemDay, 74 year to the reunification of the city after the 6-day war. To me it means freedom to visit the Wailing Wall after 19 years of its being off-limit under Jordanian rule. I received my name there in 800 BCE, and our son Daniel was BarMitzva there in 1976. https://t.co/VhJQa8RGGI
