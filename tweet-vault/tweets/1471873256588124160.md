@stephensenn @AndrewPGrieve @yudapearl @PavlosMsaouel @f2harrell @smueller @ChristosArgyrop i agree, and DoE books are within the arm’s reach… but, I’m thrilled with thought experiments… plus i’m not impressed with cavalier attitude in planning, conducting and interpreting RCTs (i’m based at largest’ research hospital in NA)
