@Jabaluck @autoregress @eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @juli_schuess @CarterPaddy Your test would make sense if DAGs would reduce the time for practical examples a lot. But I think theory is quite easy, and can make us work through practical examples a bit faster and cumulatively. Hence, again, I do not see that DAGs crowding out practical understanding.
