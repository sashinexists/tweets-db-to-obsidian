@ArielOrtizBobea @causalinf Ed Leamer asked me the same question. Take your favorite algebraic representation, say 3 structural eqs., and ask your students if it has any testable implication, or, which parameter is estimable by OLS, or identified by some IV. Its doable, yes, but have they been asked before?
