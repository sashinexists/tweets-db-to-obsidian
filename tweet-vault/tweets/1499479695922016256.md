@yudapearl @ADAlthousePhD @stephensenn @soboleffspaces @SMuellerLab Professional pride, certainly not.  Working decades in clinical trials, yes.  I suggest talking to clinical trial experts and studying key reference texts such as @stephensenn seminal Statistical Issues in Drug Development 2nd edition.  Then your assumptions will change.
