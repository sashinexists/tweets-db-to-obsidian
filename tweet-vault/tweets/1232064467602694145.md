@yudapearl @jim_savage_ @Jabaluck @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @MariaGlymour @autoregress We went through a 1980-90s phase of  many nonlinear Micro Econ structural models with poorly understood identification properties. This gave "structural" a bad name, although the bad name should have been "lack of clear identification."
