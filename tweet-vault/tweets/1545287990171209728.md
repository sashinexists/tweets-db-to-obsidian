@KabirCreates @ProfLaurenRoss @KordingLab @shansiddiqi The beauty of Hume's counterfactual definition of "cause" is that, for 2 centuries, people thought it's final, and no one asked: "So how do you define counterfactuals?". Why? Because counterfactuals are so entrenched in our mind, we thought they're irreducible primitives.
Wrong!
