Was honoured to be given a 'Portrait of Courage' award by @CAMERAorg this week.

I do what I do because I must. I do not see self-preservation or truth-telling as 'courage'.

Greatest motivation?  Knowing that if I do not fight now, my children will have to fight a greater battle https://t.co/MuH9WgdOM3
