@jos_b_mahoney @jasonintrator @glogauer_jakob Charging people with anti-semitism is stone-age. Edward Said is guilty of a worse offense: Zionophobia, denying Jews the right to define their collective identity after writing volumes on "Orientalism"-the right of Arabs to define themselves. I'm sensitive to logical consistency.
