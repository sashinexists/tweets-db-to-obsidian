Chapter 2 introduces us to Hume’s theories of causation. 

1st, regularity: sometimes things are *regularly* followed by other things. 

Is this causation? If so, how regular is regular enough? How many times do we have to observe steam after heating water to say it’s causal? https://t.co/exoZqFBfqW
