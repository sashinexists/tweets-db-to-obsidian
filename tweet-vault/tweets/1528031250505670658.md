@aynumazi @yudapearl @AOC @deborahlipstadt @bellingcat I think it's quite possible it was an IDF soldier and so do some Israeli officials who have said so openly. Doesn't change the fact that she should respect facts, process, and *at the very least* caveat accurately. "It seems very likely..." This is basic stuff.
