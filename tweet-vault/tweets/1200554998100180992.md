@omaclaren @Lester_Domes @EpiEllie @ConiByera @LucyStats @AlexaYakubovich @AnjaLeist @rohitpojha @AbbyCScience @_MiguelHernan @casualinfer The expression "X causes Y" is used in scientific conversations, and it often stands for the formal condition "Y(x) is NOT constant in x." But some people use it more narrowly, to mean E[Y(x)] is not constant, or even E[Y(1)]&gt;E[Y(0)]. #Bookofwhy
