@eduardohorta @agpatriota @michael_nielsen I interpret your hesitation to mean: It depends on the causal relationships between X, Y and Color. Agree. Absent these relationships we cannot decide if X would increase or decrease Y for that person. No need to bemoan science, we need only glance at the causal graph. #Bookofwhy
