@yudapearl @jsusskin @LeCun What I take from @LeCun's point is, saying 'NN's can't do X' masks the more useful discussion of 'how do we get NNs to do X?'. If we say 'regression can't do CI' then we discourage research to use regression with CI, versus 'to do CI with regression requires an extra step'.
