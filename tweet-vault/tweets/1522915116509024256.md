@yudapearl @4noura Conflating?

It doesn't take very much observation or investigative effort, whether on streets of London, NYC, college campuses or West Bank to hear the alternating cries against Israel &amp; very specifically against Jews 

Is it perhaps coincidental?

What it isn't is conflation
