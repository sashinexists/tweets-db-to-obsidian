@stephensenn @f2harrell @soboleffspaces It is easy to imagine that A and B could be different from O, but this is not the question asked.
1. We count on O being different, else it would not add  information on top of RCT.
2. We seek formal definitions of "comparable" "similar" &amp; "different" to avoid confusion.
