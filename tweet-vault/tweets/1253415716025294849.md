@autoregress @guilhermejd1 @analisereal @Chris_Auld @Jabaluck @gelbach @HeerJeet I did not say "ARE" causal models. I said "emanate from" a structural model, or, "can all be derived from" a structural model. Do you buy that? Do Imbens-Rubin-Angrist-Peschke buy that? This is the 1st Fundamental Law of causal inference.
