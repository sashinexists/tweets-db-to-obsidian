@_MiguelHernan @deaneckles @yudapearl Isn't "feel free to quantify the causal effect of anything you can name" a misrepresentation of what @yudapearl has said? If I've understood correctly he says "feel free to quantify the causal effect of any variable in your DAG", which seems radically different?
