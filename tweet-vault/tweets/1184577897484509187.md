@IzaTabaro @yudapearl How can we take that word away from them?
People like Mehdi use “the concept” of antizionism as a cover for their antisemitism. “I’m not an antisemite, I’m just against the idea of Zionism.”
Precisely why he works so diligently to brain wash that antizionism is not antisemitic.
