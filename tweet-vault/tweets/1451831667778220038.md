@daniellenewnham @JewishJournal Oh, yes, this interview is mine. And the picture is of my grandfather and his family, about 10 years after arriving to Israel to re-build the Biblical town of Bnei-Brak. The little guy is my uncle, the first boy born in Bnei-Brak, who taught me English &amp; about 200 songs.
