@jiafengchen42 @lihua_lei_stat @VC31415 @yudapearl @artistexyz @ShalitUri @CasualBrady yeah I agree that the language is confusing, at least for this statistician! I'd replace Judea's "estimand" with "estimator," "functional of the observed data," or "identifying functional." I'd also replace his "query" with "estimand" or "causal estimand." Does that help?
