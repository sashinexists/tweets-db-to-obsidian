@hallam @titudeadjust @MaxBoot Two false premises do not make 1-state feasible.
(1) Likud will accept 2-state if based on "end of all claims" (recall Olmert was Likud). (2) Israelis resistance of 1-state (left &amp; right) is fiercer (to the death) than Hamas resisting 2-state. Conclusion: 2-state + End of Claims
