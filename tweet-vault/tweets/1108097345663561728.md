@Jabaluck @eliasbareinboim @autoregress @yudapearl @CarterPaddy thanks for the link, i'll get to it when i can slot it in, but it doesn't answer my question. i asked you to define "good causal empirical work." this means i would like a concise summary of what you understand this topic to be. it helps me to not erroneously fill in the gaps.
