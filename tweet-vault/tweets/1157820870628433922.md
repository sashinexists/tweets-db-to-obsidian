In a DAG, the case-control situation seems clear to meüëáüèº... selection is a consequence of the outcome and the match factor and is therefore a collider. 

So, makes sense that we need to adjust for the match factor in a case-control study to block that path &amp; the confounding. 2/3 https://t.co/tjrhyiKOba
