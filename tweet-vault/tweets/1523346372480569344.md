@soboleffspaces @stephensenn I would only add that trialists describe RCTs in a language/jargon that is inaccessible to non-trialists. They perhaps understand what they get out of the trial, others must guess. They often  tell us it's not ACE, but have hard time telling us how/if it's related to ACE.
