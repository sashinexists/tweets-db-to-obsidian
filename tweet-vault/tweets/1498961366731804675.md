@stephensenn @raj_mehta @SMuellerLab would react to treatment and (the same individual) to denial of treatment. I think this finding calls for some informed curiosity, perhaps even a sweeping enthusiasm. I am always open to examine criticism, once it is cast in the language of counterfactuals, not probabilities.
