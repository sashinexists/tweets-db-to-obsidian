@jmwooldridge @yudapearl The solution for the equilibrium tax is both a "structural" object and, again, a PO, 

p*_{i,(t,x,w)}. 

Now, if you observe different levels of t, then the "treatment effects" literature might provide some very useful empirical approaches to learn about "the effect of t on p"
