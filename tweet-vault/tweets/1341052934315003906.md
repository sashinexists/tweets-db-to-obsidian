@yudapearl @VC31415 @JaapAbbring @Chris_Auld @DonskerClass @lewbel @steventberry If we replace "DAGs" with "some kind of structural model" (which could be DAG, PO, or something else), I agree.  In some cases the reason for leaving implicit is benign (e.g., model is obvious and has been discussed formally many times already). Sometimes not.
