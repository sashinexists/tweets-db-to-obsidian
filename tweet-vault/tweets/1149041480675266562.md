@Jabaluck @fuzzydunlop123 @yudapearl @autoregress @PHuenermund @pablogerbas @juli_schuess @MariaGlymour @EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer @metrics52 @eliasbareinboim Wouldn't it be more efficient to motivate why the DAG is what it is (A causes B because..., It is plausible that A is independent from C given D), rather than motivate what can be automatically derived from it (we need to control for X because...)?
