@Grady_Booch @ben_golub @Jabaluck @lreyzin Absurd? Maybe, but not useless. Once you hold the logic of causation in your pocket you can easily generate counter-examples to any over-generalizing conjecture, something that was hard to do without. Look at how Reichenbach conjecture fumbled not having such logic.
Not useless.
