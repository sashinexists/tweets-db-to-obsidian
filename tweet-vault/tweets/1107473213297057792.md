@Jabaluck @yudapearl @Susan_Athey @joshgans Maybe there are other papers. My understanding is that DAGs are often used in epidemiology because for many applications (for example, when you need to estimate an effect of multi-period treatment with attrition) inference w/o DAGs can be hard (though not impossible).
