The purpose of SCM is not to "estimate a SEM model" but to answer causal questions, e.g., what is the efficacy of a given vaccination. Here, ( surprising to many SEM folks), you can get many quantitative questions answered just from the qualitative structure of the DAG plus data. https://t.co/g6ztWYOXve
