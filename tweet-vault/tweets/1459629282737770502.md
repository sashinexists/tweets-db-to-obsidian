@TaymAlsalti @yudapearl @DJMinded No, I don't think things work in "vicious cycles." People are smarter than that. They're responding to problems they perceive. When we don't understand them, it's because we don't see what they're seeing, not because they're knee-jerk animals blindly walking into a trap.
