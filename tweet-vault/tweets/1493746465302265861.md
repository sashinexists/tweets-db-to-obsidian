@NeuroMinded @WiringTheBrain @mpigliucci @BobbyAzarian @erikphoel @SMcfarnell @PsychToday @Sara_Imari @DavidDeutschOxf @danieldennett @skdh @SamHarrisOrg @bgreene @yudapearl I agree. I wonder if free will is hanging on in there as a catch-all antonym to determinism. It's because deterministic ideas lumber on that there seems to be a need for a "not that" term. Still I prefer to see the discussion couched in terms of volition, agency etc.
