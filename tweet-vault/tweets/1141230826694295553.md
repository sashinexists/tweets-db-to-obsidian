@yudapearl @sherrirose @laura_tastic @PWGTennant @EpiEllie @AlexBroadbent @StatModeling @Lester_Domes @MaartenvSmeden @Lizstuartdc @JMichaelMcW @JohnRTMonsonMD @WhitneyEpi As @PWGTennant noted earlier, this debate can end up as a battle of semantics. Main diff for me is implementation. For pred model, dont need to wrry about time or relationship of inputs with each other. For causal model, I pay v careful attention to time and how variables relate.
