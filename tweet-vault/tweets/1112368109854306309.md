@PHuenermund @dlmillimet @snavarrol @yudapearl @a40ruhr @causalinf @PossebomVitor @nickchk says, "Read the Book of Why to learn how to be a good empiricist and don't read Mostly Harmless or examples of good empirical articles by Angrist, Card, Krueger, Chetty, Gruber, etc..." then he is flat out mistaken and leading people in the wrong direction.
