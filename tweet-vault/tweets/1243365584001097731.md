@btolgao @tvladeck @deaneckles @rabois @Jabaluck I've been in this playground since 1990, see  https://t.co/NWrofODrQk. The PC algorithm (Verma's IC) may discover beautiful structures and we know its limitations. Jona's-type algorithms rest on non-scrutinizable assumptions (eg. additive noise), may turn out promising.#Bookofwhy
