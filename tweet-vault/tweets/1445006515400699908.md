@stephensenn @ESteyerberg @LinkedIn @Lester_Domes @MariaGlymour @NP_Jewell #Bookofwhy, p.216 says: "the students eat in one of two dining halls with different diets." I interpret it to mean: "each student eats in one of the two dining halls, and these two dining halls serve different diets." How did you interpret it?
