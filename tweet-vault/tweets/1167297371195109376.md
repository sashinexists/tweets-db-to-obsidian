@analisereal @thosjleeper @DanielNevo @ildiazm @mgaldino Great, you just proved that "linear models" imply homogeneous effects, but not the other way around. Linear combinations of nonlinear functions also guarantee effect-homogeneity. [Assuming that by "effects" we mean differences eg E[Y|do(x1)]-E[Y|do(x2)] @Bookofwhy
