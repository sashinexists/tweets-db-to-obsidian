@omaclaren @yudapearl @PHuenermund As I told u in the past, if you can, do your diff equations, great.  if they are causal, causality can be claimed, sure. Most causal problems do not enjoy having the true causal model, so the need for causal inf. HMs are about sample-efficiency for after the causal step is done.
