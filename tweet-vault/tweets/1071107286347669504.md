@stevesphd @eliasbareinboim @mendel_random @jwbelmon If you believe in a division of labor  you would appreciate that after you think hard about a real-life problem with unknown DAG there is still some work to be done, i.e, to store the fruits of your thinking, to interrogate it, to combine it with data, etc. this is our challenge.
