@omaclaren @djvanness @ConiByera @AndersHuitfeldt Yes, ‘interaction’ a concept that is formalised in SCMs . Compute P(Y|do(x),z)) and check if it depends on z. Note that this quantity is computable from full SCM specification. Data is needed only to supplement missing specifications, say P(u), or functional forms #Bookofwhy
