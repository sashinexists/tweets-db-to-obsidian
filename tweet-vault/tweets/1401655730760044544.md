@yudapearl @AndrewWattEU I don't think Chomsky has a problem with a specific defense system. It oversimplifies his stance. He suggests that it is being financed by the US is problematic, since it is against the US laws to dispatch arms to a country that is violating human rights. I don't know the others.
