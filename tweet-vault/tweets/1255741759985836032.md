@KyleCranmer @tdietterich @StanfordHAI Simulators are causal, and every causal model (completely specified) can be used as a simulator. But I can't see how DL can act as surrogates for these models, since the inputs to DL are data, not the ropes behind the data, and the inverse mapping data--&gt;ropes is not unique.
