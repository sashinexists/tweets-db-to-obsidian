@cdsamii @analisereal @_MiguelHernan @aynumazi @Harvard I like potential outcomes too, and use them as much as graphs. You know why? Because, given a graphical model, I know what Y_x means, where it is in the model, how it is derived from the model, etc. It is a good language to define the quantities we wish estimated. #bookofwhy
