@WiringTheBrain @DrYohanJohn If we ask: Why is experience in the world so important for intelligence? How is it encoded in the mind after it is no longer experienced? How it is accessed, etc. we get closer to replacing that experience with a surrogate program, thus rendering that experience unnecessary.
