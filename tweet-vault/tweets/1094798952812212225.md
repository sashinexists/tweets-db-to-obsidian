@yudapearl @KordingLab @djinnome @analisereal @manuelbaltieri Hmmm. Are we back into semantics re what a "model" is?

The more interesting question to me is: how can we learn "models" from data only? Bc that is what the brain seems to be doing! Does that need an embedded cognition/AI approach? I.e. an existing physical model?
