@soboleffspaces @dylanarmbruste3 @gottfriedmath @yudapearl @nickchk @Lizstuartdc @PWGTennant This vision of @yudapearl is in the end a misleading wishful thinking (with structural models wich is one of many options). The causality is in the data and the generating processes of it. Not what you are trying to estimate. The former is evidence and the latter is invidence.
