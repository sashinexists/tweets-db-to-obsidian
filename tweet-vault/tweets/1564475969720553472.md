Anyone claiming to be doing counterfactuals using Bayesian Networks (Rung-2) should be challenged with the example on p. 35-36 here:  https://t.co/PqATlrRh91.
Jordan's paper defines counterfactuals as E[Y(1)] which is Rung-2. I do not see any R-3 counterfactuals, say E[Y(1)|Y]. https://t.co/6YzZ7sJ1Cv
