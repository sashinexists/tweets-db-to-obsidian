@instrumenthull @geomblog @MeganTStevenson @PHuenermund @paulgp @dlmillimet @pietrobiroli @eliasbareinboim @josh_t_dean I don't have a favorite empirical analysis. I don't know what insight such analysis can provide before we agree on how discrimination is defined.
The useful information from such studies lies in the data themselves, perhaps well summarized and organized, not in remedial actions.
