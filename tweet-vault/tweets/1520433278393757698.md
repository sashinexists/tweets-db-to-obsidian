This is the hubris we deal with in the trenches, @yudapearl. As a genius of logic, what do call it when:
1) a person cannot apply a concept to another time (ie: crt as Hitlerâ€™s approach)
2) a person wears blinders about the negatives in an idea (ie: not seeing the bigotry of crt) https://t.co/UkHhBq68sE
