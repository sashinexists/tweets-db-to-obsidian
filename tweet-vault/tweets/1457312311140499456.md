@hubert_misztela @zeynep If by "statistics and 'data-science" they mean the two disciplines as they are practiced and taught today, then hell no, "data science" isn't that kind of a thing: https://t.co/gWpMQEIWhX . But if they mean "data-enhanced-science", where calculus rules supreme, by all means.
