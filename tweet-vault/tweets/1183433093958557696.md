Every Jew, at one point, has their "pound of flesh" moment. It happens when they realize that they could never hand over enough "pounds of flesh" to appease their detractors. And since no amount of denouncing Israel or Zionism or wokeness are ever enough, we finally stop trying. https://t.co/l0X8dCtuni
