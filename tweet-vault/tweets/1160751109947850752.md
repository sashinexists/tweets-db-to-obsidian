@Chris_Auld @autoregress @steventberry @MariaGlymour @Jabaluck @IvanWerning @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas Sorry, but Eq. 3.46 in Causality reads: b = E[Y|z]/E[X|z]
It is a ratio of two conditional expectations, not "two reduced forms". The former are descriptive, the latters are causal -- like water and oil.  IOW, E[Y|x] conveys no causal information, RF's do! Can't equate.#Bookofwhy
