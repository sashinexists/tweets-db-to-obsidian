@autoregress @yudapearl @Jabaluck Great food for thought, thanks Peter.

If I could elaborate on the empirical setting, I might change in the following way:

X: committed a crime
Z: crime recorded in databases

This highlights that there are two types of error that could occur:
(X = 1, Z = 0) vs. (X = 0, Z= 1).
