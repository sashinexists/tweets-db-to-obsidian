@mrsaladfingers2 This is practically impossible, and that is why no one in CI tries to learn, or assume an entire causal model. Instead, we are trying to answer causal questions using only what we do know about the model, eg, that symptoms do not effect diseases, &amp; prayers do not effect traffic.
