@yudapearl @tdietterich @StanfordHAI At the last NeurIPS, there was a Causal Inference Meeting. I met there several people from Microsoft and Google working on causal inference. Maybe CI will be incorporated in the current AI centers, don't you think? Or CI incorporated in the Stats/Computer/AI graduate programs?
