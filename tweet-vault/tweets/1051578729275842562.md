@KatieMollan @_MiguelHernan @yudapearl @Lizstuartdc @AviFeller I suppose it depends on what assumptions you are willing to make. If you can find a person/weighted group of people that can reasonably be assumed exchangeable with the person of interest, then you are identified. But, given the article you linked, that sounds pretty hard to do.
