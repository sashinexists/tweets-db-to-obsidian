@EpiEllie @malco_barrett @NeuroStats @l__ds @ken_rothman In DAGs, if you want to quantify a specific interaction, all you need to do is to estimate P(Y|do(x),do(z)) and find out to what degree the effect of X on Y is modified by Z. This is a do-expression, so it is estimable by do-calculus. Done. No bells, no fancy articles @Bookofwhy
