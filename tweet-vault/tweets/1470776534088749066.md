@f2harrell @stephensenn @smueller @ChristosArgyrop @soboleffspaces @AndrewPGrieve @PavlosMsaouel The observational dataset plays no role in conventional RCT studies, or in IV studies. It can play critical role if properly analyzed and properly combined with RCT studies. But this requires unconventional methodology which I have hoped you would embrace with glee. It's worth it
