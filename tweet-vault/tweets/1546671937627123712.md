For an academic organization (Association for Israel Studies (AIS)) that counts Zionophobes like @Ian_Lustick among its former presidents, breaking ties with MESA must be a traumatic catharsis. MESA can safely change its name now to IMESA - the Irrelevant side of ME Studies. https://t.co/XTTr0gXJMw
