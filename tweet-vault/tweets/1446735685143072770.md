@AlondraNelson46 @WHOSTP @EricLander46 It is misleading to give the public the impression that "math tools exacerbate health inequalities." The new math of cause and effect does exactly the opposite, it gives scientists the tools to define what "inequalities" we wish to eliminate or sustain, and the means to do it.
