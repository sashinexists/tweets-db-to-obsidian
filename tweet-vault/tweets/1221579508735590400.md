@jeffreywatumull @talyarkoni @dileeplearning @adamlewisgreen @GaryMarcus @BethCarey12 What humans do, we observe; what NN can't do we can prove. Eg, humans shout: "Impossible" when told of a drug that is good for men, good for women and bad for a person. What would NNs do if given Simpson's data? What would a statistician do?
