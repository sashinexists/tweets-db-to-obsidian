"We need to deal with this very dangerous idea that says being pro-Jewish means you have to be pro-Israeli or being pro-Israeli means you're automatically pro-Jewish &amp; you're immunized from the charge of anti-Semitsm. Lots of anti-Semites support Israel &amp; Netanyahu." -me on @CNN: https://t.co/I9vJCwS8gB
