@KordingLab @danilobzdok @blei_lab @StatModeling That's one of them, thanks. As you can see, the causal character of Simpson's paradox is avoided like a plague. Why? I am asking you as one who knows the solution: Is it possible to solve w/o graphs? Those who can't solve a problem, avoid it, and cover up the void..#Bookofwhy
