@Jabaluck @AdanZBecerra1 @dmckenzie001 @jenniferdoleac @PHuenermund @causalinf The only thing I keep insisting on is to have solved problems that have solutions and identified those that don't. If you are attempting to solve problems outside this range, I suspect your problem resides in the "don't" category, or it is not well-defined. "good/bad dag" is one.
