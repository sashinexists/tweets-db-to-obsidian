I was 2 years old on Kristallnacht, November 9-10 1938,
It was a quiet night in Tel Aviv. My parents understood
what's coming, but kept it from us, so we can grow up free. We did. And by the time we understood what kristallnacht meant, Egyptian war plains came attacking Tel Aviv. https://t.co/vFQaZVCTn1
