@eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @mendel_random @jwbelmon [THREAD] I appreciate the question, but I fear we are talking cross-purposes here. When I talk about assessing assumptions, I'm thinking about a real-life problem in which the data-generating mechanism is unknown, not a toy example where the DAG is known.
