@raymondshpeley @eliasbareinboim @autoregress @CarterPaddy Agree. But sometimes the slow bites are the hardest ones of all. I truly do not know what "good causal empirical work" is, anyone knows?. Note the hardship we go through to have economists opine if identification is important for policy analysis. All small bites are giants
