@yudapearl @omaclaren @PHuenermund 2/2 I'll leave Oliver to answer u question, but HM is about estimation, not identification (ID). The discussion gets misleading bec the 2 issues are mixed &amp; seems to suggest causal inference is feasible without ID. Classic: this is not useful for the problems I am interested in..
