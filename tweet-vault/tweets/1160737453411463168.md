@Chris_Auld @autoregress @steventberry @MariaGlymour @Jabaluck @IvanWerning @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas 1/I am the last one to claim that a concept is not "useful" its usefulness however needs to be clear, else it turns into "abusefulness." I am happy to finally hear from someone what it means to that someone, not to another person, or to some textbook, and I will try to refine it,
