@PHuenermund @yudapearl @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal It's much better to come up with a research design that minimizes the threats to validity than one with many threats that are claimed to be ruled out based on earlier research, since the earlier research is likely of low quality or a different context.
