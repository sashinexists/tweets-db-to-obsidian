@Jabaluck @maximananyev @PHuenermund @yudapearl Finally, a challenge to @Jabaluck and @yudapearl: find a study using your non-preferred ID strategy that you think good, and explain why.  Find one using your preferred ID strategy that you think lousy, and explain why.  If you have trouble finding them, I am sure I can help.
