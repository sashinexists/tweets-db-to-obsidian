Letâ€™s remember the #Hanukkah story of Jewish revolt against oppressors took place in Judea, the Land of Israel. 

And the rededication of the Temple in 165 b.c.e. was in, yes, Jerusalem. 

Worth recalling the next time anyone claims no Jewish historical tie w/ Israel &amp; Jerusalem! https://t.co/RFnX5geFwy
