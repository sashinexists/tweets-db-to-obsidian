Your history professor understood the music of history. I wouldn't be alive if it weren't for the Balfour Declaration (1917), which gave my grandfather the push to leave boiling Europe , rebuild a Biblical town (1924) and then create a miracle called Israel (1948). Kudos!Balfour! https://t.co/seqd6pv3mS
