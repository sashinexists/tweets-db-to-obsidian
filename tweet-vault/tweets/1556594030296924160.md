@pietrobiroli @MeganTStevenson @PHuenermund @paulgp @dlmillimet @yudapearl @eliasbareinboim @josh_t_dean @uhlily I agree one could consider the causal effect of getting a Y chromosome vs not. Is that enough? One could also consider the causal effect of skin color in a iPod seller's display arm, as in Doleac/Stein. Are those specific manipulations so different?
