@vhranger @PHuenermund I am not speaking graphical models. I am speaking econ 101 where you teach simultaneous equation models and you explain why OLS does not always work.
A curious student asks: when can we estimate a parameter, say beta, using OLS. This is not a provocative question. Why fight it?
