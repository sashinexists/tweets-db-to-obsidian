Another quick trip in the time machine to the Roaring 20s where we meet Jerzy Neyman, the 1st person to use potential outcomes in a statistical analysis.

There’s also a🤣story about Fisher trashing Neyman’s office b/c Newman dissed his work in a lecture! Ah the good old days🤣😂 https://t.co/HH3E4lxWAc
