@RonKenett @f2harrell @stephensenn @learnfromerror So, my next project is to read Cox (1958). Give me a week to see if I can translate Cox's hints to encodable knowledge. This conversation reveals a basic disconnect between "designers" and AI-ers. The former THINK, the latter WORRY: Can I automate my thoughts? #Bookofwhy
