@cdsamii @yudapearl @PHuenermund @dhillon_p @deaneckles 2/3 Both issues are important, but estimation may be not meaningful (i.e., stats consistent), regardless of all the cleverness of the proposed method, if identifiability is not achieved. I think both Judea and I were a bit surprised since ID was deemed “old stuff” &amp; solved.
