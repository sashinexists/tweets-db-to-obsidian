@yudapearl @JoshMandelOhio @AdamMilstein The Bund literally believed that Jews should be free to make their home wherever they are

It's pretty absurd to claim they were wrong while simultaneously proclaiming how threatened Israel is. It's pretty clearly after 70 years of Zionism that it hasn't made Jews any safer
