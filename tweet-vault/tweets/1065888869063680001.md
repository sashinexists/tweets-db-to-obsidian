The most common example is IV. We train by randomizing the instrument Z, and we wish to infer the effect of action do(X) that was not accessible in training. For that we need a causal model, assuring us that Z is not directly affecting Y (the outcome), an untestable assumption. https://t.co/dSlkL7oQaI
