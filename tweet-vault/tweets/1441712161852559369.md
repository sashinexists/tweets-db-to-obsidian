Sweden decided to boycott Durban? Amazing! And I placed all my hopes on Norway! Just because the Norwegians I met impressed me as descent. A classical example of selection bias: I shamefully forgot the descent Swedes I met in Uppsala 1991. Memory is the key to a biased judgment. https://t.co/50tjTH1iR0
