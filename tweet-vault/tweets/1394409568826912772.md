@Martin_Indyk @DovWaxman @POTUS @netanyahu It is untimely to play "seen it before" and ignore the bleeding and suffering of millions of Israelis under Hamas rockets, even if it means only 10 years of (partial) relief, if IDF significantly curtails Hamas capabilities in the next few days. @POTUS supports reason, not Bibi.
