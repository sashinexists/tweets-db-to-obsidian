@RaniaKassi @yudapearl @EinatWilf @newzionists “Settler colony” is also a human concept, undergoing evolution through time and open to interpretation, but fair enough, that’s not a hill I choose to die on. I’m guessing Israelis would be more open to discuss this notion if we acknowledge countries like the US share this label.
