@biosbenk @f2harrell @Lester_Domes @PavlosMsaouel @drjgauthier @yudapearl @kdpsinghlab @AleksiReito Yeah I’d love to see how that works too. I’m less optimistic about the posterior, as parametric Bayes does not have an analog of robust standard errors that I know of, and therefore uncertainty quantification is misleading. I know Frank doesn’t think this is an issue, but I do.
