@yudapearl @davidmanheim @AndrewPessin @EinatWilf Look, I think very highly of you, but there are limitsðŸ˜‰. Seriously, though, long before Exodus, the descendants of Jacob ("he who wrestles with God") were anything but atheists. True, they had some polytheism mixed in with their Judaism, but nobody's perfect.
