@yudapearl @y2silence I feel a cold coming on. I want to decide whether taking a zinc tablet will help. I'd like to know Pr(i get cold | do(i take zinc)) vs Pr(i get cold | do(i take no zinc)). If we swap you for i these probs could change. I'm not sure i see any problem with the do notation here...?
