@ShalitUri @VC31415 @CasualBrady IMHO, the overlap should be clarified. @yudapearl actually emphasized the joint positivity in his pioneering ’95 Biometrika paper (Def. 4), but many DAG folks forgot it. Joint positivity is an overlap cond. under which the do-calculus is proved to work. In general, it’s trickier.
