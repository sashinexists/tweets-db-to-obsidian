@yudapearl @athos_damiani @agpatriota I don't mean changing the paradigm, just the words. It's possible to explain the situation informally or explain it formally without using DAGs, with formulas and arguments. 
The same with regression: one can prove that the model minimizes the MSE without using probability theory
