I got it. You are doing "response type" analysis (as in  https://t.co/CDXuHKKFk7) in the context of CBN, and derive bounds on probabilities of counterfactuals. I have no objection, of course, the bounds are tight. Except I would call it counterfactual analysis, instead of CBN. https://t.co/XokivLMBzJ
