@MelMitchell1 @adibzaman @eliasbareinboim @tdietterich "Schema Networks" are quite powerful languages. What happens if we run them on some toy problems in #Bookofwhy? Do you think they would give the correct answer? Put differently, do you think they could be useful in answering some questions in #causalinference ?
