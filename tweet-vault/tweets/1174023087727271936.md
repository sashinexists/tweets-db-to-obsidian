@strangecosmos @yudapearl @GaryMarcus @ylecun Depends what you mean by "knowledge". "Mechanisms" might be more accurate. The analogy I see is to a toolkit full of tools, each w/ specific uses, which can be combined in many different ways to solve a wide array of tasks. "Knowledge" does not seem to me clearest word for this!
