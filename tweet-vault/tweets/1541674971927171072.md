@Martin_Kramer @MESA_1966 That's not enough. Each should write to demand that their university revokes its affiliation with MESA. I wrote to UCLA Chancellor, but it didn't go very far, considering that I couldn't say: "MESA activities undermine the legitimacy of the Center I was hired to run." @DovWaxman
