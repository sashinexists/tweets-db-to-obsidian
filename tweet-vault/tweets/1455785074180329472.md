@siminaboca @cmirzayi I am pleased you've noticed that #Bookofwhy covers Bayes' Theorem differently from standard stat books. Indeed, the profound contribution of Thomas Bayes is missed by most Bayesian statisticians; they hate to deal with questions of epistemology which, we, in AI cannot dismiss.
