@dopamine_uptake @TheStalwart @pierre_rochard @nic__carter @WhiteRabbitBTC @100trillionUSD @coinmetrics If by "useful" you mean "causative", then the question need be rephrased to read: What causal assumptions are needed to make Granger causality "causative"? I recall (vaguely) that someone has tackled this question, but the answer, naturally, requires causal vocabulary. #Bookofwhy
