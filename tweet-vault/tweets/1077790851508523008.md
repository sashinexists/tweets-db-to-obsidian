@autoregress @PHuenermund @EpiEllie @totteh Perfect question, closer to the core, once we clarify what is meant by "infer from data". Surely, nothing can be inferred from obs. data alone; But can we infer those elusive causal effects from data+ASSUMPTIONS,-- same assumptions we use in standard obs. studies? #Bookofwhy
