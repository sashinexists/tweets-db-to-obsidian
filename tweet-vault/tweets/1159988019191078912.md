@omaclaren @alexpghayes @steventberry @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @yudapearl @MariaGlymour @autoregress What do you think an analogy to econ might look like? (obviously I'm not expecting you to reinvent all of empirical social science in a few tweets ;) ). Aside: modern mathematical econ began when Paul Samuelson borrowed L'Chatelier's principle to model market equilibria.
