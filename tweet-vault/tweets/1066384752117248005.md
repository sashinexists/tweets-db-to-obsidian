@yudapearl @dustinvtran @eliasbareinboim @jasonhartford @zacharylipton @CsabaSzepesvari @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @ShalitUri The ad is general, for interns across the research and machine intelligence group. Applicants are matched to projects and mentors based on their interests. Given the wide applicability of CI, students shouldn't wait for "causal inference" to appear in the ad to consider applying.
