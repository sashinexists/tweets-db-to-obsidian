@yudapearl @causalinf @PHuenermund @lewbel @Susan_Athey @pedrohcgs @snavarrol @TymonSloczynski @tdetonberry @MacroPru Let's distinguish between:
1) A specific DAG (which summarizes many different models)
2) The class of all DAGs under which the OLS assumptions hold.

The paper you cite above is saying, if we commit to a specific DAG, we get improved efficiency. But we don't need to, right?
