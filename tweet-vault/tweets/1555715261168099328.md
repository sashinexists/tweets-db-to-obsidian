Just talked to my sister in Tel Aviv. She's going to  sleep with cloths on -- the shelter is level 1, and she lives at level 4 of the building.
I tried to lift her spirit, reminding her how  worse things were in 1948, under Egyptian bombing. Price of independence.
Shabbat Shalom. https://t.co/itU994Z1Nc
