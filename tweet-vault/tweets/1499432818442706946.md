@stephensenn @yudapearl @f2harrell @soboleffspaces @SMuellerLab This idea that it’s “easy” to get lots of people in group C because they can “surveyed” instead of recruited from the same setting is just wrong.  If those people are recruited differently than the people enrolled in the randomized trial, they are not from the *same population*
