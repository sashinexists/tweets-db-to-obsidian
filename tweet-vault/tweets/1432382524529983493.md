@MatheusFacure @yudapearl @VC31415 @causalinf Nice point Matheus. What I am thinking is that D does indeed influence Y0 and Y1 to some extent when there is bias SB. That is why my latest opinion is that we should keep that pesky arrow in G_1 in general, but for a RCT, for which SB=0, we should use G_1 without the pesky arrow
