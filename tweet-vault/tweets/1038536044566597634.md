@f2harrell @EpiEllie @PWGTennant @ken_rothman @statsepi @GermsAndNumbers Moreover, let's not forget the PS is only as good as the covariates that enter into it. Asymptotically, the bias-reducing capacity of PS is identical to ordinary adjustment for the same set of covariates.  That is, PS is a smoother, not a bias-reducer. #Bookofwhy #causalinference
