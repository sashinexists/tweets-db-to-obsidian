@stephensenn @soboleffspaces @PavlosMsaouel @f2harrell @smueller @ChristosArgyrop @AndrewPGrieve @HL327 I’m curious to learn what “concurrent control” is. Plus, if something varies from study to study, what measures can be taken to insure that effects estimated under RCT applies to the target population under normal use of treatment?
