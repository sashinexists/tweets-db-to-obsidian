@KordingLab @fhuszar @tdietterich @zittrain @eliasbareinboim @suchisaria I dont see it this way, since I hardly touched on "estimation" (ie, going from finite sample to distribution); I call the stat dept once I get an estimand. Econometrics has been doing some limited identification correctly. How limited? See: https://t.co/Jf1SkgV3CK, #Bookofwhay
