@autoregress @eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @PACESconsulting @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @Jabaluck @HeerJeet I agree with you second and third statements, your first statement is not true though. It would be akin to saying we can't develop probability theory, numerical integration, or other general tools that works for several problems, not just a specific one in a field.
