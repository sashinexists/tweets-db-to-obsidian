@BlueManifold @dmonett Indeed, now that I re-read it, they do emphasize the importance of causal and counterfactual reasoning. I did not pay attention to it in 1969, being deep into heuristic search. It is only when I saw causality as the force behind Bayes networks that I asked: what is it? #Bookofwhy
