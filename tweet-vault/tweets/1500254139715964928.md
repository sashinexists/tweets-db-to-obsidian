@f2harrell @ADAlthousePhD @PavlosMsaouel @GustafRydevik @stephensenn @soboleffspaces @SMuellerLab "Putting off" is a blessing when a complex problem can be broken into two almost independent subproblems, to be solved sequentially. Can't we solve the asymptotic bias first, and then attend to estimation, ie, going from finite samples to distributions? Has RCT solved the former?
