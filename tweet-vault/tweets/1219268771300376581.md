@yudapearl @deaneckles Take a theoretical debate - like: "is voting habit forming?" - that's hard to study because the DAG is large and not well understood. Then someone working in the literature (like @aecoppock) realizes old voter mobilization exps can be used as instruments (https://t.co/kQRYc3HVY8)
