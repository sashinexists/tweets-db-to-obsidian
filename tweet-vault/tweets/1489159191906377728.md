@EinatWilf is at her best in this video. My only reservation of the debate is its giving a  Zionophobe like @mehdirhasan the honorary title "antisemite" - he does not deserve it, he is not a product of uneducate parents; he knows where it leads, and pursues it cold bloodedly. https://t.co/ThkVT9yQsY
