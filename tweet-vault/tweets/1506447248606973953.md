@soboleffspaces @causalinf @nickchk variable in your data: X,Y,Z1,Z2,Z3. What cond. Ind. assumptions do you need? (1) those implied by P(z1, z2,z3)? or (2) by P(x,z1,z2,z3)? or (3) by P(x,z1,z2,z3,y) or (4) by others? Once we know which, we would be able to check if they are sufficient for the task.
