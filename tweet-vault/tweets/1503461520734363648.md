@JFronczekMD @soboleffspaces @yudapearl @AndrewPGrieve @suiss70 @miquelporta @f2harrell discard the observational data, whereas Pearl has a way of putting it to good use. As to your second question, remember, PNS and CATE measure different things. I would do BOTH, calculate CATE and find bounds for PNS. Why be satisfied with only the point estimate of CATE?
