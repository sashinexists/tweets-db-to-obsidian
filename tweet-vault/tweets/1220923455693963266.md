@HannesMalmberg1 @HarryDCrane The partial derivative definition is a good alternative to do(x). It has obvious problems with discrete x but, more importantly, we do not really have a calculus based on partials that can deliver something like the backdoor/frontdor adjustment formulas. Do we? #Bookofwhy
