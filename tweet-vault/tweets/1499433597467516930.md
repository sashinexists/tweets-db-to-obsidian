@stephensenn @yudapearl @f2harrell @soboleffspaces @SMuellerLab As we often note, the benefit of randomization is that it gives us some degree of insurance against those unmeasurable or non-obvious potential confounders, of which there are many (otherwise we could predict peopleâ€™s outcomes much better than we currently do)
