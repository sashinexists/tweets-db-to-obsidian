@f2harrell @ildiazm @Lester_Domes @PavlosMsaouel @drjgauthier @yudapearl @kdpsinghlab @AleksiReito Iâ€™d love to see that approach with the model parameters mapped into a more sensibly weighted average HR. The Bayesian approach is appealing for this because intervals for the summary are automatic from the posterior with no need to derive nasty influence functions.
