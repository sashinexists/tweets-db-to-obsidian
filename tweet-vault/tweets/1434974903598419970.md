My point is that I do not take it as personal,  but as part of a deeply entrenched ideology that says: We don't need to see the needle, we can discover it tabula rasa. Moreover, the less we see of it, the less biased would the one we discover be. See : https://t.co/dxqdoqMsQm https://t.co/t2xUCjDm8g
