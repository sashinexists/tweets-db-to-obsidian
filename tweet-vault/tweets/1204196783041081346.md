@mstephens999 @y2silence Do-expressions are probabilisitic, involving populations. To go to individual level, we go to SCM
(Stractural Causal Model),  where U=u is the individual.
All counterfactuals, PO, ignorability etc etc can be derived from a fully specified SCM.(Including "consistency")#Bookofwhy
