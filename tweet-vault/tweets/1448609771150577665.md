@Raamana_ @KordingLab @andpru @yudapearl It's a disgrace that these people ban DAGs from CI, akin to banning the use of pictures from a geometry class. However, Judea gives them a strawman by insisting that they either use SCM or take the road. They can always defend themselves by claiming that SCM are unnecessary 1/2
