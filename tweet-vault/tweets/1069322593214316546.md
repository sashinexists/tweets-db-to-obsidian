@alexdamour @yudapearl @CsabaSzepesvari @mendel_random 5/5 I understand for folks close to Rubin that he doesn’t have any clue of what’s going on in the field for decades. So, to say that there is any sort of symmetry between the alleged discussants does not find support in the facts, and it's REALLY unfair. The asymmetry is glaring.
