Any paper that uses the First Law of Causal Inference should be taken seriously by deep  learning folks. However, going from population data to individual behavior requires  bounding methods (Tian etal (2001),  https://t.co/quhPwU0HuA.) I don't see how the paper can do w/o them. https://t.co/wNZ3NLdo15
