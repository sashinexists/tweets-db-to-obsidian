@SteveRo48195125 @MartinRavallion @Jabaluck My understanding of backdoor is that we do not ADD variables. THEY ARE THERE in nature, we just acknowledge their existence in our mental picture of reality and check if they are needed. We ADD them to our identification strategy, if appropriate, not to the model. #Bookofwhy
