@DrDavidMathers @RashidaTlaib @JGreenblattADL She didn't really have to do that. @RashidaTlaib  never promised her voters, nor her donors, to watch for PA violations of human rights. She promised them something totally different, to malign Israel in every possible way, incessantly, and she lives up to her promises admirably.
