Well put. I've always fround the "vicious cycle" metaphore to be misleading. There is no cycle when one side aims to maximize deaths and the other to minimize deaths, or when one says: "equally indiginous" and the other: "You're colonialist" or between "We We We" and "Me Me Me" https://t.co/NUyUlwlwWi
