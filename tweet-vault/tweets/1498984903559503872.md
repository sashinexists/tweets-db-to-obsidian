A suggestion in my "EBM 2.0" piece was for "EBM" to "partner with other disciplines", including causal inference: https://t.co/jf8VXgAhHu

I also said the job of these fields is to make themselves, &amp; their science, accessible (to "EBM") 

This would be a good place to start https://t.co/rhPRs0w9gJ
