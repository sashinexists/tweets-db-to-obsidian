@fhuszar @tdietterich @zittrain @eliasbareinboim @suchisaria "If a pattern ppp is seen in the data then something (SSS) must hold true in the world".  The language of "my algorithm tries" of "my algorithm optimizes" etc reminds me of AI in the 1970's "MYCIN tries" "ELIZA optimizes" which was later replaced with declarative writing style.
