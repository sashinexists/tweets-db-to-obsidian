@instrumenthull @PHuenermund @paulgp @dlmillimet @pietrobiroli @yudapearl @eliasbareinboim @josh_t_dean @uhlily I worry that there is a very deep rooted instinct in economics to think of race as a variable in the data set. Discrimination then becomes limited to instances in which people with different race indicators have different outcomes, holding constant observed and unobserved factors
