@yudapearl @stephensenn @soboleffspaces @JFronczekMD @EpiEllie @f2harrell @ADAlthousePhD @artistexyz @statsepi @GuyattGH @GRADE_WG But which "conclusion holds"? Your conclusion is that no females were harmed (i.e. 0%) and 21% of males were harmed (see page 10 of your paper). My 'dual' causal reasoning concluded that 71% of females were harmed and 28% of males were harmed (see also https://t.co/WuLNmHJqQ4).
