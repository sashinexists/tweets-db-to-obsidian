@yudapearl @f2harrell @stephensenn @learnfromerror Aha - now you refer to re-randomization. This is done to randomization outcomes that seem too regular. Re-randomization is used to enable enhanced generalisation. Coxâ€™s 1958 book discusses this. It is also in the slides of my causality workshop that i sent u a while ago.
