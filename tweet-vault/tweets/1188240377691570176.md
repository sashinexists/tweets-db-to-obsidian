@fuiud @PHuenermund Your description of "DAG approach" comes from people who never used DAGs. Correct description: Take any applied PO+IV study, and add a tiny question: How do we know, given our problem description, that Z is a good IV? Once you answer it, you got an "applied DAG" study. #Bookofwhy
