@yudapearl @stephensenn @soboleffspaces @ADAlthousePhD @PavlosMsaouel @GustafRydevik @f2harrell Another issue with this is that O is not directly sampled from the same target population. Ideally, the question we want to answer is “what is the ATE of A relative to O?”. But that is not possible. Or not as robust as A vs B.
