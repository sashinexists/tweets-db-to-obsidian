Beg to differ. You don't turn an apple into an orange by looking at it through colored eyeglasses. #Bookofwhy (pp. 143-150) shows why randomized trials are merely skillful interrogations of effects that exist with or w/o the trial. An apple is an apple when properly defined. https://t.co/PPftegNDDw
