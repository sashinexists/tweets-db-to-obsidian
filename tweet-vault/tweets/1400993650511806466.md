@SLMsociology @PHuenermund @yskout Bidirected edges need not be avoided if we understand them to be what they are: a hidden father of the two head variables. If we have a father of three, we show it as such. In linear systems, three bidirected arrows are equivalent to the hidden father of the triple. No confusion.
