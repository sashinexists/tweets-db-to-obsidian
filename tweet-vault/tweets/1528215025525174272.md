@yudapearl @aynumazi @AOC @deborahlipstadt @bellingcat For sure: the behaviors you highlight are a real issue. I think the only thing we see differently is the degree of danger she's creating. I've also become more skeptical of her approach to all this over time. Maybe I'll end where you are. Not sure.
