@dylantmoore @FenCameron Honored to be on this thread but, frankly, much would get brightened if you specify what rung of the ladder you are at. eg. Is Yitzhaki formula an exercise in identification or estimation? Why not average over heterogenous effects? Over all: Speak Ladder, not 'good economists'.
