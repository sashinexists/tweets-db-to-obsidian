@desertcran @johndawkins @athie_gnome @gibletsMoon @rasmansa Pearson &amp; Spearman are both useless on the unit circle.

The problem is not how we define correlation.  The problem is that causation is not defined.  Causation is a philosophical idea not a statistical one.

Some associations are meaningful wrt to manipulation, some are not.
