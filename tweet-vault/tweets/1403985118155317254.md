@DavidPKramer @UCT_news Hilarious! I am trying to understand how they must feel in S. Afrika, having been science-deprived for centuries. I should be able to understand b/c in Jewish education too science was taboo, till 1700's. But once lifted taboo turned into a national obsession. Why not in Afrika?
