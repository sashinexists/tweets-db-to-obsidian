@wattenberg @GoAbiAryan @JeffDean @bengiswex @mahimapushkarna Readers of #Bookofwhy would believe that counterfactuals are impossible without "opening the black box". So, either #Bookofwhy is wrong, or the explanations generated by this system are not the same as those labeled "counterfactuals" in the Book. E.g., Does Oxygen explain Fire?
