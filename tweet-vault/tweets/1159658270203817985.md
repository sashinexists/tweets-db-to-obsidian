@maximananyev @yudapearl @causalinf @steventberry @paulgp @lewbel @Undercoverhist However, if you write-down a DAG without considering what designs will lead to credible identification and end up trying to estimate the treatment effects without any kind of credible tDAG, would I believe any of your estimates? NO!
