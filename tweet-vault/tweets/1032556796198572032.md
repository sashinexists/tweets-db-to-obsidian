@wgeary @MSFTResearch @akelleh This is great news, which should make causal inference a household item. It reminds me of  Max Planck's quote: "A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing opponents to see the light, but because  a new generation grows up that is familiar with it." (1949) #Bookofwhy
