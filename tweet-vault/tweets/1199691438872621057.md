@AnjaLeist @rohitpojha @EpiEllie @AbbyCScience @Lester_Domes @_MiguelHernan @casualinfer 2/2 forced to ask only questions that someone put in their mouth. I can't join this constraining culture; would you? And all for the sake of emulating RCT? I can't. A good framework is one that allows researchers to articulate what they truly wish to know. #Bookofwhy
