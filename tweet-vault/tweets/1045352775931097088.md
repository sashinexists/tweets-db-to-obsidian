@juli_schuess @eliasbareinboim @deaneckles @yudapearl Think about wage gaps: if you fiddle w/ someoneâ€™s genes, then you might change the occupation they select. So, to get at a gender wage gap accounting for this, you need an intervention that simultaneously changes gender &amp; other things that preserve occupation preferences. 1/2
