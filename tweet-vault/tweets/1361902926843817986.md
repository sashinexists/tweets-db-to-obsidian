@yudapearl @AdanZBecerra1 @dmckenzie001 @jenniferdoleac @PHuenermund @causalinf Now suppose that your conceptual knowledge is some weighted average of many possible mental DAGs, further complicated by the fact that you have meta-knowledge that any mental DAG you make explicit will likely omit many confounding paths.
