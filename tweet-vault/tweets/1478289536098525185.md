@zioness_lioness @femmerrhoid @87yrs @blakeflayton @MairavZ @InnaVernikov @SAFECUNY @EinatWilf @Eve_Barlow @bariweiss @newzionists We are no longer nice to the Palestinians who, since 1922, claimed that Jewish self-determination is lower priority, and should yield to Palestinians right to sole ownership of the holy land. This, I think, is what @femmerrhoid decries so emotionally. My sympathies.
