@maximananyev @yudapearl @causalinf @steventberry @paulgp @lewbel @Undercoverhist Yes, correct! And I suggest you have a compelling research design to cleanly identify treatment effects for some subpopulation and combine that with observational data. Can a DAG or structural model help with that? YES!
