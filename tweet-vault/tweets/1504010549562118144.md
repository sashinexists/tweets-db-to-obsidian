@yudapearl @soboleffspaces @JFronczekMD @EpiEllie @f2harrell @ADAlthousePhD @artistexyz @statsepi @GuyattGH @GRADE_WG We can progress by understanding each other. I have spent a fair amount of time reading your writings, find them extremely interesting and important and have said so. But if you have any familiarity at all with RCTs then your statements and questions about them are baffling.
