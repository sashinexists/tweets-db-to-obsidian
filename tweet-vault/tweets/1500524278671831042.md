@alexis_andreyev @SAFECUNY @CUNYkcc @CUNYKCCPRES @ChancellorCUNY I have been there, in October of 1947, before anyone was kicked, and I have heard Azzam Pasha promising us "Rivers of blood" and Monumental massacre", then 5 armies attempting to implement his promise, all before anyone was kicked out. Still, Biden is talking 2022, not 1948.
