@thefeministcop @zeemo_n @Shade_Nox @EinatWilf Palestinians need a "narrative" very very badly, as attested by two observations: (1) Their relentless effort to invent one on a (questionable) genetic linkage to the Canaanites. (2) Their relentless effort to deny Jewish connection to the land. They know: Narrative = Trust Deed
