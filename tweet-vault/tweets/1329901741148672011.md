@eliasbareinboim @PHuenermund @AndersHuitfeldt @yudapearl I'm not sure this is a subtle point.

Under DAG 1 only let's say M is identified. But we don't believe DAG 1.

Under DAG 2 only, M is not identified. But adding another plausible assumption (which may be nonparametric, eg monotonicity) M is partially identified.
