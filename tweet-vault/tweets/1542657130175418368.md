As a holder of a dual citizenship, Israeli+American, I am proud to introduce readers to the new Prime Minister of Israel, Yair Lapid, a man of vision and integrity, who just took office today, and is being congratulated by my President Joe Biden. To their partnership!- LeChayim! https://t.co/VYcJMHVEbh
