1/ I've been thinking, why is it that economists prefer to go from regression to causation and not the other way around? I believe it goes back to the 1960-80's when an influx of statisticians flooded econ., for whom the world begins and ends with regression, the rest is frills. https://t.co/HoRLupbw2d
