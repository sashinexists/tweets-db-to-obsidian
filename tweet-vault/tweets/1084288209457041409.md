@omaclaren @PHuenermund DAGs are to regression as fire is to water. But this is secondary. I mentioned the problem of "deciding which covariates to adjust for" because it remains an elementary problem in @causalinference that 90% of statisticians cant do. Can BHM folks do it? Can anyone that you know?
