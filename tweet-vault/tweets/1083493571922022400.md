@cdsamii @PHuenermund @dhillon_p @deaneckles @eliasbareinboim Can you help us understand what "old stuff"  you are using? I for one am not familiar with any "old stuff" that would solve even a simple transportability problem (unless the two environments are (conditinally) the same, ie ignorability). One "old stuff" would do. #Bookofwhy
