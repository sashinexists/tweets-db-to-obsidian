@RMCarpiano @eliowa @DrScottBalsitis @jmicrobe9 @CAPublicHealth collaborated w @UCBerkeleySPH  to design, conduct, &amp; analyze this study using causal inference methods. Along with matching, investigators used directed acyclic graphs to select variables for de-confounding. DAGs described well in "The Book of Why" by @yudapearl.
