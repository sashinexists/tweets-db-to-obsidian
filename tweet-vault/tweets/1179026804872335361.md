@GilmanStephenE @DavidSFink @amitabhchandra2 @AdanZBecerra1 Not right! You have thus identified the causal effect of X on Y contingent on the assumptions that (1) A and B are the only confounders and (2) the system is linear. Contingent effects are weaker than absolute effects, but they can be VERY useful. #Bookofwhy
