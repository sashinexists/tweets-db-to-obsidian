@RWJE_BA @yudapearl @PavlosMsaouel @f2harrell @stephensenn @smueller @ChristosArgyrop @AndrewPGrieve maybe not the right amount of â€˜magicâ€™? ðŸ˜‚
but itâ€™s good you â€˜feel good aboutâ€™ your amazing work ðŸ¥³
perhaps adjustment is â€˜evilâ€™? ðŸ¤­
can you share a causal diagram?ðŸ¤©
have you tried to block non-causal paths?ðŸ¤«
sorry, the back-door criterion wasnâ€™t known to â€˜all peopleâ€™ in 40s
