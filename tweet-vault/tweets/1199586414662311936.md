@rohitpojha @AbbyCScience @Lester_Domes @_MiguelHernan I have asked epidemiologists colleagues if they knew what "target trial" is. They smiled and admitted "not a clue". Can you explain it to the uninitiated? What if one's ultimate goal is not a "target trial" but a "target policy? Would anything be missed? #Bookofwhy
