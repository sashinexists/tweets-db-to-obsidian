@jasonhartford @eliasbareinboim @dustinvtran @zacharylipton @CsabaSzepesvari @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @ShalitUri By invoking interventions, RCTs provide us causal information that can be used, of course, in a restricted causal inference, i.e., inferring consequences of those
interventions.  A causal model is needed to go BEYOND, and infer consequences of actions that were not randomized.
