@autoregress @guilhermejd1 @analisereal @Chris_Auld @Jabaluck @gelbach @HeerJeet If "Yup" means "Yes" then we disagree on the 2nd "Yup". Imbens-Rubin-Angrist not only do not mention this connection in their books, they resist the connection like a plague. But I welcome your first "Yup", and hope that we can agree on its logical implications
