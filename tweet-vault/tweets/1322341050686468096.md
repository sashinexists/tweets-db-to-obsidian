@AgEconomist @PHuenermund @causalinf @Susan_Athey This looks like an interesting paper to read over the weekend, with one caution: When speaking "causal reasoning" look not at the algorithm, look at the input information, and ask what judgments it carries. Probabilistic judgments, be they trees or forests, are insufficient.
