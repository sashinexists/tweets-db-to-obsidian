@kinggary @LydiaManiatis @CMichaelGibson @joshgeleris @CNN @NEJM Infinite sample is not a matter of wishful thinking, but one of understanding where bias comes from. Asymptotic analysis, fortunately, allows us to separate two such sources: finite sample and wrong set of covariates. The former diminishes with bigger data, the latter does not.
