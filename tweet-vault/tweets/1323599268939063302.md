I am not surprised that RL-driven dogs would try to alter  barometers. What is puzzling to me is why you say: "Causality within RL is beginning to receive mainstream attention" and not "RL within Causality should receive some attention." RL is a technique -- Causality is nature. https://t.co/oXGwixXNtK
