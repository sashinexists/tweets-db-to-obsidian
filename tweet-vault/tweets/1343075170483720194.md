@yudapearl @ShalitUri @VC31415 @CasualBrady Thank you for the comment! Just curious, do you have a reference for identification when the joint density of observables is not positive everywhere? For example, for front-door adjustment with treatment T, mediator M, outcome Y, what happens if P(m|t)=0 for some values (m,t)?
