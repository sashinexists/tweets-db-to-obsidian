@arenasmario @Kangaskhan6 @SlezakPeter @btselem @hrw Sadly, victimhood wins. Through a combination of crafty deceit, Qatari money and herd mentality, the world, media and especially academia all fall for Palestinian victimhood slogans. When was the last time you saw an Israeli mother on CNN? A child? A human face? Do they have any?
