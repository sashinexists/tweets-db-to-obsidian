Thanks for posting. Happy Kincaid sees CI as a "revolution" in economics but, where on earth does he get the idea that "moderating causes" and "necessary causes" are "not easily handled" in SCM? The whole theory of attribution is  built on them. See      https://t.co/QQa4sdcJMT https://t.co/D4khSeNXr2
