@alexdamour @yudapearl @CsabaSzepesvari @mendel_random 1/3 I'll share my tweet-size historical read., but the claimed symmetry couldn't be more unfair. Pearl started ~30y ago reading Rubin, Lewis &amp;everything that was available in the field (incl earlier authors). Anyone familiar w/ Pearl knows how thorough&amp;deep he approaches things.
