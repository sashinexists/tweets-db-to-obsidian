The delegates at yesterday's Congress made a mistake. The boasted about going there to celebrate, not to pass resolutions. The should have passed one resolution: "We hereby declare anti-Zionism to be a racist ideology, to be named Zionophobia". We need a Herzl to push it through. https://t.co/90W0S8nwE5
