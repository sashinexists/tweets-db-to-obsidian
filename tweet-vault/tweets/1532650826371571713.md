@yudapearl @shalom123211 Rule 3 can not be deduced from 1 and 2.  Rule 3 assumes that there is some independence in a graph where incoming edges of x and (some of) z are omitted.  However, this does not trigger rule 2, which requires this independence in a graph with more edges (all incoming edges of z).
