@stephensenn @yudapearl @ESteyerberg @LinkedIn @Lester_Domes @MariaGlymour @NP_Jewell My naive interpretation is that @yudapearl generally focuses on bias (or relevance per @XiaoLiMeng1â€™s terminology) whereas @stephensenn is also interested in how to properly estimate variance (robustness) because the two are intertwined and ignoring that is problematic.
