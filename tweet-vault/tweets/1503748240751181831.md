@stephensenn @EpiEllie @yudapearl @f2harrell @soboleffspaces @ADAlthousePhD @artistexyz @statsepi @GuyattGH @GRADE_WG I also enjoyed the podcast. These concepts seem revolutionary:
(1) If PNS is more applicable to the patient in front of us than ATE, we would need to revisit the way we apply research results
(2) Assuming (1) is true, we would likely need to revise the EBM hierarchy of evidence
