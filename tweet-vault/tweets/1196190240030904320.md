@stephensenn @f2harrell @RonKenett @learnfromerror The reason I was changing from "hair color" to "eye color"  was to guess the general criterion for choosing a blocking factor. But if it is so simple:"CONSIDERED PREDICTIVE" we can automate it, all we need is a model of predictiveness."  Now you will say NO &amp; I'm back to guessing
