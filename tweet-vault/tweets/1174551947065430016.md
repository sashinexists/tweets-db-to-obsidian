@FabItMart @causalinf The self-referencing is in your mind. I am pointing to a dramatic shift in philosophers writings, from informal to mathematical (crediting Wright), which was surprising to me. By fearing self-referencing, you risk missing the benefits of the shift. Enjoy them first. #Bookofbook
