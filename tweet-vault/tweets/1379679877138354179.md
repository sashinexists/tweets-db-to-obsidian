@omaclaren @alexeidrummond @Lester_Domes @PavlosMsaouel @cubic_logic @neuro_data @KordingLab @Lizstuartdc @BetsyOgburn @yudapearl This baffles me...how can DAG do SDE or ODE? The A in DAG (acyclic) shows how limited they are. They underlie an Aristotelian view of the world, where there are causes and effects, prime movers and all that crap that we've know to be false since at least Maxwell's equations. 1/n
