@vatsal_maru @BernieSanders Poor Bernie wants us to believe he is a "man of principles," but is appointing advisers (eg Sarsour) that are consumed by unprincipled agenda. Why? Because other advisers tell him "this is what young voters go for" -- an unprincipled "principle", proven a disaster by Corbyn.
