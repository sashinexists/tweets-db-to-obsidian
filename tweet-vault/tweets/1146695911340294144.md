Your paper is an eye opener, glad you posted it. If it was not 1am I would have continued reading it, for it is written in a CI language and a well-structured style. The fact that it won @SIGMOD2019 best paper award may signify a new age for fairness folks. #fairness #Bookofwhy https://t.co/AyAANxGgTO
