@EpiEllie @eliasbareinboim Happy that you pointed to the source paper. Note though that the paper starts quite friendly and provides ample examples. Importantly, the paper aims to be "anti-standardization",  showing that standard "standardization" methods (ie, re-calibtation) must be revamped. #Bookofwhy
