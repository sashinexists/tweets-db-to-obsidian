@yudapearl @AdaptiveAgents @djinnome @AgEconomist @causalinf @analisereal @chuston1776 @eliasbareinboim @DeepMind I'd say the goal of PP is having the ability to specify a model of a DGP as "an arbitrary set S of probabilistic expressions".  "deriving the tightest bound on any desired  expression E" (i.e., algorithmic inference) is not the end, so much as a necessary means to the end. @jwvdm
