@omaclaren @eliasbareinboim @stephensenn I dont think #Bookofwhy states that 1)Statistics doesn't deal with causality. It quotes Fisher's definition: "Statistics is summarizing data," and it decries the vacuum in stat textbook, and it places Fisher's DoE precisely where it belongs in history of CI. What would you add?
