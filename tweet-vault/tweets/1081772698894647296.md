@SLMsociology @erikdbwestlund @stevepowell99 Why should anyone disagree? If readers can solve the toy problems on page 93-100 of Primer https://t.co/Sf5yw328zl, kuddos to you and your book. If you feel they could stand some help, it is easily done. We have enough disagreements with the arrow-phobes. #Bookofwhy
