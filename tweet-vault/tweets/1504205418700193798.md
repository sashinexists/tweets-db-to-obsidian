@yudapearl @stephensenn @soboleffspaces @JFronczekMD @EpiEllie @f2harrell @ADAlthousePhD @artistexyz @statsepi @GuyattGH @GRADE_WG In the male observation study, disease mortality on no drug was 180/600=30% so from the RCT, the expected mortality on drug was 30-28=2%. However the actual mortality on drug was 30% suggesting deaths from adverse drug effect was 30-2=28% by not avoiding fatal contraindications.
