@steventberry @jim_savage_ @Jabaluck @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @MariaGlymour @autoregress As a student of philosophy  I see it as a challenge to track down sources of confusions in various disciplines and, although econ. is still an enigma to me, I can see interesting patterns in econometric thought, going from inadequate notation to inadequate definitions. #Bookofwhy
