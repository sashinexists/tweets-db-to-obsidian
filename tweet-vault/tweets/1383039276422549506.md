@ildiazm @PavlosMsaouel @drjgauthier @yudapearl @f2harrell @kdpsinghlab @AleksiReito I made no such assumption. It's an empirical fact that typical analyses in health&amp;med sci use logistic or Cox model coefficients as gold standards, forcing us to deal with these tech problems. I have argued for standardizing/marginalizing since 1981 eg see https://t.co/7JBKmZYLMl
