@yudapearl @eliasbareinboim @EpiEllie @l__ds @malco_barrett @NeuroStats @ken_rothman I think this describes the limitation of pies perfectly. Thinking about simple problems with 2 variables - ok. Thinking about more realistic problems with N variables - not so easy. Your pointing out that this is an NP-complete problem helps make that clear.
