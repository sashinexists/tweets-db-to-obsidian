@sweichwald @atypical_me @GunnarBlohm @KordingLab @dan_marinazzo Your definition is a good one. But I would like to embrace partially specified models under the label "causal model" . For example:   X-----&gt;Y + X&lt;---U---&gt;Y
which does not identify P(Y|do(X)) is still a causal model; it tells us P(X|do(Y)) = P(X)
