@stuz5000 @isaacdecastrog Yes, you are wrong!! I grew up in Israel and have been listening to her intensely since. Never have I heard a call for destroying Palestine (except for a few outlawed loonies) Simultaneously, NEVER have I heard acceptance from ANY Palestinian leader, cleric or educator. Never.
