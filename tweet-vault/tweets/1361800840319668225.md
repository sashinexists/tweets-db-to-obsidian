@Jabaluck @dmckenzie001 @jenniferdoleac @PHuenermund @causalinf Angry again? @dmckenzie001 asked: How to make a matching estimator convincing? The completeness property of CI tells us more than just "Is a given model identified?". It tells us what MUST hold in the world to make an estimate valid and, please note, that no one can do better.
