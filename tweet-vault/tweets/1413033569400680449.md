@artistexyz @VC31415 @causalinf Bayesian Networks, you are right, are just abstraction of probability theory. But probability theory is Rung 1, and we need two more Rungs to climb: Causal Bayesian Networks for Rung 2, and Structural Causal Models for Rung 3. See #Bookofwhy p.51 https://t.co/ZB6eQJXoMI
