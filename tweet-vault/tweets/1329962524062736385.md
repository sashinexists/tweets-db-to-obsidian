@guilhermejd1 @deaneckles @PHuenermund @AndersHuitfeldt @yudapearl The point is that we want to start as less committal as possible in terms of assumptions, and just consider increasing them as needed (since it requires thinking hard &amp; may introduce problems). Focusing on a particular class misses the point of the framework &amp; is a distraction.
