Multi-congratulations to our colleague Onyebuchi A. Arah (@oacarah) for his election as President-elect of SER (@societyforepi). Arah is a past winner of the 2016 ASA Causality in Statistics Education. So, safely, SER will be heading in the right direction under his leadership. https://t.co/Rfiw1EXz52
