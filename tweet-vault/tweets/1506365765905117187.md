@yudapearl @causalinf @nickchk DAG is built around 2 dedicated nodes: cause X and effect Y. The arrow btw them is the subject of causal inference. Other arrows and their direction are assumed. If X -&gt; Y is identifiable due to the graph topology, we rule out their covariation b/c of the network of dependencies.
