@MariaGlymour @AdanZBecerra1 @_MiguelHernan @EpiEllie @ProfMattFox @yudapearl 2/2) Standard statistical theory tells you that these two designs have to be analysed differently, although the difference is not in how the point estimate is calculated but how the standard error is. Can DAGs tell you the analyses are different?
