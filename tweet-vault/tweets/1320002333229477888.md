@Sam32895821 @HananyaNaftali @EinatWilf I would like to believe that Kerry does not wish the demise of Israel and that his misconceptions were the result of na誰ve ignorance and wishful thinking, like those of many Europeans: Agree on borders and, OOPS, children in Ramallah will stop singing "Tel Aviv is stolen land."
