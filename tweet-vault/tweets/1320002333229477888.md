@Sam32895821 @HananyaNaftali @EinatWilf I would like to believe that Kerry does not wish the demise of Israel and that his misconceptions were the result of na√Øve ignorance and wishful thinking, like those of many Europeans: Agree on borders and, OOPS, children in Ramallah will stop singing "Tel Aviv is stolen land."
