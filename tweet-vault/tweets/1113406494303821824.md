@robertwplatt @Jabaluck @maximananyev @yudapearl I'm not sure whether @yudapearl has a preferred indeitifcation strategy though. Because they're all subsumed by the DAG framework, that's the whole point of the discussion (and @Jabaluck says that we only need about three identification strategies, if we do them right).
