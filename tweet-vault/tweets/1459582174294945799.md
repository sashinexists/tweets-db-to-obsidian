@TaymAlsalti @yudapearl @DJMinded I didn’t mean to suggest Israelis don’t carry around misconceptions about Palestinians.

But your point about power answers your question. Palestinians have an existential interest in improving their understanding of and ability to influence Israelis. That’s not true in reverse.
