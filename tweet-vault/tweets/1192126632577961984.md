If we are ever going to reach a peaceful solution for both Palestinians &amp; Israelis, it requires us to first open our eyes to all the injustices. I am so proud of my friend @RepAndyLevin for coming from a place of love that will lead to an honest dialogue about the occupation. https://t.co/YiT1CrLYy1
