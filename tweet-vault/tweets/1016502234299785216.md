@miquelporta @_MiguelHernan @Tfeend @societyforepi @EpidemiologyLWW Miquel, I would be the last person to spoil your dinner, but there is more to paradoxes than just "all paradoxes are apparent paradoxes". By detecting what intuitive nerve they jangle, paradoxes reveal to us the way our brain works. Something worth exploring.
