@matloff @yudapearl If we observe barometric pressure drop, we might conclude rain is more likely: P(Rain|Drop). But if we *intervene* to set barometric pressure to lower level, we wouldn't expect that to *cause* rain. That is, we wouldn't expect P(Rain|do(Drop)) to hold. These seem distinct to me.
