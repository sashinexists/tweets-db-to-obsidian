@MacroPru @causalinf This tutorial is restricted to potential outcome (PO) framework, and is subject therefore to all the weakness of PO.  Missing are: structural economics,  causal hierarchy, criteria of covariate selection, modeling assumptions,  testable implications, causes of effects, etc. etc.
