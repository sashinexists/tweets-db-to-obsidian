@Jabaluck @IvanWerning @steventberry @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @yudapearl @autoregress Wouldn't his def'n of reduced form also include what is often referred to as the first stage model (ie if instrumenting effect of X on Y using Z, I say regression of Y on Z is reduced form and regression of X on Z is the first stage?) X is also endogenous.
