@diydatascience @BHilbush @tdietterich True. It's just "one or two examples":
https://t.co/8zCnf0WPB2, "they are only toppling statues", "its the cost of re-painting" (SF Mayor), and "It's just one Reinoceros!" (Ionesco,1959) https://t.co/j8iqGWdLOx

I hope it ends here, but it's our duty to say: "it may end THERE."
