@GaryMarcus @tejasdkulkarni @ylecun @_WEEXIAO @Vlad_S @drfeifei @neurobongo @TimKietzmann @demishassabis @sama @ilyasut @koraykv @AndrewYNg @swarat And my IMHO is that it is not the "right symbols" that should be the focus of discussion  but "what it is about the situation"  that we want to describe. If I fit data with polynomials or random forests or with convolutional NN, I am still just describing, not interpreting data.
