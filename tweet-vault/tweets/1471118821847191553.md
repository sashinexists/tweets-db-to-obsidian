@yudapearl @AndrewPGrieve @PavlosMsaouel @soboleffspaces @f2harrell @smueller @ChristosArgyrop 1/2) The issue is not so much selection bias. It is well known that patient outcome variation from trial to trial is greater than within. See https://t.co/YKOixjifim
This is why clinical trials use concurrent control. There would be no point otherwise.
