And I can't get over the following puzzle: How come no one asks "what's the definition of Islamophobia?" Users of the term assume that the word is self-defined,  self-evident, obvious and axiomatic. Why is  Zionophobia not self-defined? Do religions have a monopoly on identity? https://t.co/OrwpbZsBop
