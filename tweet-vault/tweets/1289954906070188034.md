@yudapearl @causalinf @PHuenermund @lewbel @Susan_Athey @pedrohcgs @snavarrol @TymonSloczynski @tdetonberry @MacroPru How frequently do economists run feasible generalized least squares instead of OLS in order to reap efficiency benefits? Occasionally, but not very often. If power is possible with more agnosticism about structure, this is preferable.
