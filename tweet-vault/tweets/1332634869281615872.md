@lewbel @causalinf @PHuenermund @econbookclub @steventberry @Chris_Auld @analisereal @jdramirezc @PhilHaile Are your students happy with the terminology "defines behavior"? LeRoy's book expresses a 30-year frustration of econ students in understanding structural equations, i.e., what kind of 'equations' are they if they do not obey the rules of algebra? Aren't your students asking it?
