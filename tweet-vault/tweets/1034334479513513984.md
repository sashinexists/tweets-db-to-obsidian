@yudapearl @PHuenermund @Noahpinion /2 For years, I have been doing an informal survey: Whenever I am confronted with a regression model, I ask the person why s/he inserted the relevant control variables. Responses:
a) "No idea" 
b) "Because this is usually done so in my field" 
No one: To block backdoor paths
