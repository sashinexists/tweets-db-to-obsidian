@lewbel @yudapearl @causalinf @PHuenermund @econbookclub @Chris_Auld @analisereal @jdramirezc @PhilHaile Well, I am going to argue that the substitution doesn't preserve all counterfactuals possible with the original model. In particular, it doesn't identify the slope of demand, which is needed for many counterfactuals.
