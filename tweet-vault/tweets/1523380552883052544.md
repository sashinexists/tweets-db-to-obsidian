This Bill will have only one effect, falsely portraying Israel supporters as opposing the two-state solution as an ideal end goal. I'm inclined to believe it is written for this purpose only. Because the bill's deficiencies would force any peace-lover to oppose it as written. https://t.co/BawQe1hlCC
