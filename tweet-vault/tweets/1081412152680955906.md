Mildly shocked that the existence of the "evaluation" community is news to Judea Pearl! 

Steven Powell's review of the "Book of Why" is very good. I recommend both the review and the book, which offers a perspective on the longstanding causal questions of economic evaluation. https://t.co/mfCoAZgVK6
