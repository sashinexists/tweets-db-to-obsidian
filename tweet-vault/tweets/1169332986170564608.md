@Jabaluck @yudapearl @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal Concerning your previous tweet: I think the DAG you will write down depends on the specific question you are studying. And then it should be irrelevant from which "side" you approach the problem, because you need to end up with correct model of the DGP (ground truth) in any case.
