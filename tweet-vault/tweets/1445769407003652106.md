@f2harrell @stephensenn @PavlosMsaouel @ESteyerberg @LinkedIn @Lester_Domes @MariaGlymour @NP_Jewell @XiaoLiMeng1 They are red herrings in the context of Lord. e.g  "clusters" &amp; "assignments" do not exist b/c there is no analyst or experimenter to "cluster" or "assign". "variance" is shown in the distribution (the ellipses). "within Halls," no variation since Halls = Diet. 
More? Speak Lord.
