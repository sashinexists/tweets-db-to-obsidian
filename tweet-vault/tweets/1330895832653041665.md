@thefeministcop @zeemo_n @Shade_Nox @EinatWilf I thought we agreed on the "equally indigenous" principle. If we did, then it is not "migrate to a land" but "return to their land" and all these populist slogans "expelling" "occupy" "steal" etc. turn empty. If we did not agree, we should go to the definition of "indigenous".
