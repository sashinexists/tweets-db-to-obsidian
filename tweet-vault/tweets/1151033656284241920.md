@djvanness @y2silence @dcmallinson @EpiEllie Good example where most people agree that Z is a modifier of the effect of X on Y, and not that X is a modifier of the effect of Z on Y. So, back to penalty analysis. What will go wrong if I mislabel them and I mistake X to be a modifier of the effect of Z on Y? #Bookofwhy
