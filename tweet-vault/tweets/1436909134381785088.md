@yudapearl @ChrSzegedy A big problem with Stanford's Foundation Models (FM) institute is that it claims that FMs are risky but fixable. I don't think they are fixable, short of boycotting them. A big risk: monopolies,like Google,and Big Science,like Stanford,will use FMs to monopolize AI commerce + R&amp;D
