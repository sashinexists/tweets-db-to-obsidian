@zaffama @artistexyz @tdietterich @BomNaKub @roydanroy do(x) is a controlled action, but not necessarily in randomized trial. A farmer asking: I wonder what my yield would be if I used fertilizer-1 vs. fertilizer-2 is asking E(Y|do(fertilizer-i))=?, while a farmer reported to be using fert-i will reap on average E(Y|fert-i).
