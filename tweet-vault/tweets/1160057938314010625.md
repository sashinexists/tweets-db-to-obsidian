@lewbel @steventberry @Jabaluck @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @MariaGlymour @autoregress I have no doubt that "reduced form" exists or can be concocted. But the question is: What useful information does it provide to @lewbel (not MHE). Put differently, what would science miss if, suddenly, all economists get amnesia and forget such a concept ever existed? #Bookofwhy
