@yudapearl @MatheusFacure @CasualBrady Sorry I don't know what SQ stands for. Can you explain? I also would really like an actual recommendation for a specific book on estimation, given the shortcomings you pointed out in my choices. Where are practitioners to go for advice/examples for how to estimate effects?
