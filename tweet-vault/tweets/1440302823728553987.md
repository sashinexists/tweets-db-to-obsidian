@gilled34 @RaniaKassi @EinatWilf @newzionists True, but Edward Said taught us that it is an ugly colonial habit to allow someone else define who you are and what you are, let alone someone who wishes you dead, let alone someone who has no qualm making his intentions public. So whose definition would you buy?
