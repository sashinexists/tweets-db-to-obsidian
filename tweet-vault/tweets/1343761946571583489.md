@lihua_lei_stat @VC31415 @yudapearl @artistexyz @ShalitUri @CasualBrady it seems clear that some positivity assumptions are not necessary when there are 2 separate identifying strategies for a single graph, but I took Judea's question to be: when 2 functionals rely on the same identifying strategy, they will require the same positivity assumptions?
