@yudapearl @suchisaria @RandomlyWalking @raamana_ Implement an SEM/SCM as a POMDP with actions to perform interventions. If posterior belief as to the effect of an intervention is equivalent to prior belief, then you've gained no evidence as to causality. Posterior belief greater than prior belief for outcome, that's evidence.
