@aleixrvr @ccaballeroh10 In Wikipedia I introduced p(y|do(x)) conceptually, not as an operation on graph, but as a distribution created once we make sure X=x is enforced. I believe even high-school kids would understand the difference btwn "the price listed was X=100" and "I raised the price to X=100."
