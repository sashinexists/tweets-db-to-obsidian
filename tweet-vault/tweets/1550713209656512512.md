@soboleffspaces @DavidDeutschOxf I am referring to statements like (Pinker p.149):"the rule saying how much to revise our probabilities (change our minds) when we learn new fact." Equating "our minds" with "our probabilities" is seductive but wrong; much of our mind (eg, counterfactuals) lies beyond probability
