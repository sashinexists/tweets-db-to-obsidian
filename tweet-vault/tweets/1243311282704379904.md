@deaneckles @tvladeck @rabois @Jabaluck Yes, we often do not have the knowledge required to answer our questions - I praise DAGs for telling us. We often have 3 equations with 4 unknowns - I praise algebra for telling me that the solution is not unique. Who else would tell us? Statistics? PO? #Bookofwhy
