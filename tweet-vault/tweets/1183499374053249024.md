Day #6 studying PCM main branches of #math p3-8, 3rd view of combinatorics concerned with mathematical structures that have 'few constraints', curious to see later how combinatorics can be combined with analysis, after all 'few constraints' might still need 'limiting processes' https://t.co/f5lCOusFGK
