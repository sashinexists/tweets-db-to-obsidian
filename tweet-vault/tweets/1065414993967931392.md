@zacharylipton @eliasbareinboim @CsabaSzepesvari @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @yudapearl @ShalitUri All the work with (online) RL is also doing causal inference. You can interpret interactions with the environment via a do operator. Interestingly, however, I haven't seen much value out of merging CI with RL. One exception is doubly robust methods for offline policy learning
