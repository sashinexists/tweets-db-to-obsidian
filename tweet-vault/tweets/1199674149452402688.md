@rohitpojha @EpiEllie @AbbyCScience @Lester_Domes @_MiguelHernan @casualinfer No objection! I am genuinely trying to understand what it is. Since it is marketed and hailed as a "new framework," I fear to be missing something by not adopting it. Am I? Or can I and my students relax back to the framework that kept us happy and productive thus far? #Bookofwhy
