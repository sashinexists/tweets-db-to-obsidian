@yudapearl @JasonConnorPhD @AndrewPGrieve @jd_wilko @f2harrell @soboleffspaces Thanks It's getting clearer. So 0.7 &amp; 0.7 in all men and 0.27 (drug avoiding) v (0.7 taking) in  women. And these are actual observed rates not effects, whereas the  0.28 in the trial are effects. 
What treatment do the drug refusers take or is that irrelevant?
