@Plinz @dileeplearning @GaryMarcus We can definitely do better, using filtered mutations, as I argue here: https://t.co/BsNCQuIVuf. But, in order to do better, we need to know what we are looking for, and what we can do with it once we find it. That is why I study what to do with a DAG once we find one.
