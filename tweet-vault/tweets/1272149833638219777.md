@sometimes_data @kareem_carr Thanks for the pointer. Note that Efron does not use the word "inference" and that he borrows the causal notion of "attribution" to mean "statistical significance" (variance reduction), confirming my observation https://t.co/XFZYzAbLHy that statistics has remained causality-blind
