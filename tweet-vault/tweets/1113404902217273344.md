@Jabaluck @maximananyev @PHuenermund @yudapearl And, can we please stop the "statisticians do...", "economists can't...", and "epidemiologists are..."  blanket statements? These are at best tiresome, at worst insulting.  I'm trained as a statistician, work primarily in epi, and teach about IV. none of these blankets ring true
