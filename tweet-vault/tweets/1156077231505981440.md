@Psylocke42356 @ZachWritesStuff @CNNSotu @jaketapper This is precisely what I tell them in almost every piece I write. Can you reciprocate? Can you repeat after me (and ask Rashida to join): "Two states for two peoples, equally legitimate and equally indigenous". No ifs, no buts, just say "equally indigenous". Can you?
