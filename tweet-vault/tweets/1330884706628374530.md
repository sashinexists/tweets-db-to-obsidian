@thefeministcop @zeemo_n @Shade_Nox @EinatWilf Take me; I am an atheist, yet Israel is my ancestral land. Not because the "Holy One" said so, but because my family celebrates holidays connected with that land, my childhood heroes (Abraham, David...) acted there, and my father (+his) prayed 3 times/day to return to that land.
