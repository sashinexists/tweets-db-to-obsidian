@mattshomepage @AgEconomist @PHuenermund @causalinf @Susan_Athey This is true for CBN (which are acyclic) but obviously not true for SCM, where Z can activate and shut-off  arbitrary functions between X and Y. Off hand, I envy not a user having to express causal knowledge in "probability trees". But I'll keep on trying to find one advantage.
