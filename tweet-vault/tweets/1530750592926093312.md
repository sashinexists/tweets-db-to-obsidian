@MaccormickIan @JessicaHullman @CzannerG @aaronylee @DrXiaoLiu I couldn't find much commonality between the #MachineLearning and #psychology papers considered. The former are data-centric. I am also wondering what kind of integration methods are available to those who wish to integrate predictive models &amp; causal inference?
