@Jabaluck @yudapearl @PHuenermund @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal This is observational data but trials have already established efficacy. The survival mediational g formula uses the warfarin effect in the data. And actually I've been oversimplifying it. It accounts time v effect. Pts go and off warf and other drugs are time varying confounders
