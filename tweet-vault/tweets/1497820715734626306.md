I would expect a responsible organization such as @Conf_of_Pres to compile a credible "Annual Guide to the Informed Philanthropist". Are they awake? Anyone with a clout to alert them to what's going on on US Campuses? @ADL ??  @AJC ?? @AEN ? I was almost going to type @HillelIntl https://t.co/B1RABytTN7
