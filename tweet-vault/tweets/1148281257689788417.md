@yudapearl @MariaGlymour @PHuenermund @EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer @autoregress I am making a substantive claim: practitioners who use the back-door criterion without searching for a quasi-experiment are typically fooling themselves. They rule out some paths and then pretend they have ruled out all back-door paths.
