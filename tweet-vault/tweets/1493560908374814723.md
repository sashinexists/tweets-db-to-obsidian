@yudapearl @ylecun @ilyasut But how do we test that that's necessary for c?
It might very well be true, but it's a theory. You can't show someone anything in the real world that can convince them it's true/likely!
To answer to a “it may be“ with “nope“ requires levels of certainty I don't think we have.
