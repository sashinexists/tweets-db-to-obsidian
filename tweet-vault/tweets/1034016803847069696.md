@Jabaluck @yudapearl @analisereal Just on your point 1) here, I’d say that conditioning is often important even with IV/RD/DID. Eg, even “sibling sex composition” is only conditionally random (as Angrist/Evans themselves noted). Whenever conditioning enters the identification picture, DAGs are helpful.
