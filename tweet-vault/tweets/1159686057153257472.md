@maximananyev @yudapearl @causalinf @steventberry @paulgp @lewbel @Undercoverhist Yes, I think that is a fair definition. More broadly, it means finding quasi-experiments (IV, RD, diff-in-diff) instead of trying to close backdoor pathways with controls and hope that the remaining variation is not confounded (this has non-zero value, but is a last resort).
