@alwynkotzee @HumaneTech_ Finally, what is true is not always what is useful.

Clinicians might want real tangible evidence but #causalinference is about estimating specific causal effects (Truth).
A variable's large effect might never be felt if there are many smaller effects also in the causal system.
