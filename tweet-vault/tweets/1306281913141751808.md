@m_clem @PHuenermund @julianschuess @nickchk @yudapearl But consider this: if among those who completed 5th grade (Z=1), we believe that those who dropout 6th grade (X=0) are on average systematically different in their potential scores from those who do not drop out (X = 1), then this amounts to saying there is unobserved confounding
