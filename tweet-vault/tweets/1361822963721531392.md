@yudapearl @dmckenzie001 @jenniferdoleac @PHuenermund @causalinf What neither of us have now is a model through which AIs can make these decisions as well or better than humans can. So how should humans make these decisions?

The "design" approach provides an answer of where to look (although future work could formalize it better).
