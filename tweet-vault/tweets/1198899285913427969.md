@yudapearl @JustinTrudeau Israel supported Nusrah (Qaeda branch) fighters to attack Druze towns from Occupied Syrian Golan. They hospitalized their fighters and provided protection for them, but not for the civilians. Israel have license for Assad, Hezbullah and Iran to kill is in the name of Palestine!
