Curious readers asked me to reveal the name of that economist who, according to Causality page 216, footnote 10, was the only one to solve for ATE in a cyclic demand-price model. I can't resist: his name is Ed Leamer, well known to many, and a remarkably open-minded economist. https://t.co/Tm4RQMk9v5
