@omaclaren @JohannesTextor We cant end this beautiful discussion on a negative note. It sure DOES guide us on what to do. First, completeness tells us that there exists no np solution if Y---M are confounded -- great  help!!!. Second, it suggests creative remedies. E.g., measure an M2 mediating M--&gt;Y, etc.
