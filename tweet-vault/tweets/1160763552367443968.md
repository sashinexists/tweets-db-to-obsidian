@autoregress @Chris_Auld @yudapearl @steventberry @MariaGlymour @Jabaluck @IvanWerning @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas We could say IV is the ratio of two conditional expectations, or IV is the ratio of two causal effects (in the standard causal IV setting). What do we gain by saying IV is a ratio of two "reduced forms"? I think that's the key issue.
