@yudapearl @causalinf @Susan_Athey @Jabaluck I don't trust my knowledge of their work well enough to summarize in 140 characters, but the first two links are good examples. Refinements in diff-in-diff, or regression discontinuity designs... Use of basic ideas from machine learning for heterogeneous treatment effects... Etc.
