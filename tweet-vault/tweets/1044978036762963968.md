@yudapearl @_MiguelHernan A view from econ: Heckman agrees with Pearl (as do I): see pg140 https://t.co/tl3ucB3Go8

Causality is defined wrt a model. Which is a separate issue from (1) whether your model is reasonable and (2) whether your model+data allow you to actually identify the desired causal effect
