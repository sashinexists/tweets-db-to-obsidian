@EpiEllie @pietrobiroli @PHuenermund @instrumenthull @paulgp @dlmillimet @eliasbareinboim We simply call the value T before the intervention T=0, and we need no assumptions. In my 2001 paper I was not even thinking about "intervention". I go to an arbitrary variable X that undergoes a transition from X=x* to X=x, for any reason whatsoever, and I ask about Y.
