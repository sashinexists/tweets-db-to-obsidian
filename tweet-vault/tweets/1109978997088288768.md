@Jabaluck @yudapearl @EpiEllie @autoregress This is a great summary. All approaches have limitations. I think the only real problem is thinking that there is only one useful approach. Learn PO, IV, DAGs, and the role of sensible study design as tools to identify causal effects, and youâ€™re better off.
