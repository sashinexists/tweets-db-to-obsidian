@yudapearl @PhilHaile Judea, I really want to believe you are better than the econophysicists who also would like to impose "science" on us (but so far manage to only have a laugh at their attempts)... Hence, before your next insult, allow me to kindly repeat this invitation... https://t.co/iGfpc1ou9f
