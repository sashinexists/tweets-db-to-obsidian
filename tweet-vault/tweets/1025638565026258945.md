@Benguimbis @LauraBBalzer @_MiguelHernan @EpiEllie @malco_barrett @ProfMattFox @MariaGlymour I am not sure you received a satisfactory answer to your question. Consistency  divides the SCM camp (#Bookofwhy) from the potential-outcome camp. The latter sees it as "assumption", the former as a theorem.
