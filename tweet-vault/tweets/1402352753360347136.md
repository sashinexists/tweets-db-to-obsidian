@yudapearl @Observe89314530 @DrMikeH49 @surgeryontv @Eve_Barlow Also, let me comment on your contention of the novelty of Palestinian identity. The Arabs were *always* aware of cultural and linguistic differences among themselves. That Palestinians were denied realization of statehood was a matter of repression, not any absence of foundation
