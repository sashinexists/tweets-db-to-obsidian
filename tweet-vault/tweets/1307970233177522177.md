@offaltube @Rezbab @Claire_Voltaire What's the point? That antizionism is only bad in as far as it is tainted with anti-semitism? That it is otherwise OK?
No way! Anti-semites are victims of ignorance and irrational obsessions, antizionists know exactly what they are doing and calculating, and it's very very ugly.
