@yudapearl @AdanZBecerra1 @dmckenzie001 @jenniferdoleac @PHuenermund @causalinf To be clear, my main goal is to convince other readers of this exchange that your more bombastic claims are false. I thought you agreed on the other thread that you cannot build an AI that will learn without you telling it that umbrellas don't cause rain? Can you do this?
