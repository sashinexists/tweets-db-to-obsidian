@cdsamii @EpiEllie @yudapearl 3/2 If we did have the mechanisms, we can compute the causal effect immediately from the model (e.g., page 205-206 of Causality, Pearl, 200)). Getting samples compatible with the observational distribution does not seem to be the solution to learn something about Y_x, does it?
