@SethAMandel @IzaTabaro I don't think you appreciate the wisdom of the 'anti-Zionism isn't antisemitism" ideology. The agenda is to claim: Yes, Israel exists, but it is illegitimate. Hence, we have a license to harass her supporters and terrorize her citizens where antisemites can't. It's ingenious.
