Thanks all for the pointers posted here to Turing-Bayes. As you can tell from #Bookofwhy, my mind only works with toy examples. I  wish I could see a toy Enigma machine with just two wheels, showing the tradeoff that Turing faced between using Bayes rule and exhaustive search. https://t.co/hNdxP2xTAI
