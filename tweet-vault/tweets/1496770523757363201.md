@AndersHuitfeldt @AndrewPGrieve @suiss70 @miquelporta My understanding is that none of the papers written on NNT captures the counterfactual nature of the word "prevent". How can I tell?
Easy. You can't articulate this notion in the language of RCT's and, as we show, you can't estimate it from RCT data alone. Time to correct!
