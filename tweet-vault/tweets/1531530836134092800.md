@TriciaRoth18 @deborahlipstadt Thanks, Tricia. I've just asked Alvin what affiliation exists between his Institute and the new Center. Aren't you surprised by the absence of "Israel" in the Center's charter? For me, it's a warning sign of reluctance to face issues, or reluctance to rethink stale paradigms.
