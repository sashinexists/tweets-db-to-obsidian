@RonKenett @stephensenn @learnfromerror Your paragraph makes students (me) believe that you need to try out both "age" and "hair colors" on the data before deciding. But you surely advise them not to waste time trying out every possible measurement. What intuition guides you prior to taking data? #Bookofwhy
