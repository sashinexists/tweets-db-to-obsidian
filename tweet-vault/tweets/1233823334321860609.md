@y2silence @yudapearl Much as I liked Book of Why, this quote is the low point of the book.
â€˜Anything that hasnâ€™t existed for 500 years prior to its own development is clearly unnecessaryâ€™.
(Begs the reader to consider whether the same thing is true of all causal developments since then ðŸ˜œ)
