@PHuenermund @eliasbareinboim I'd never give up hope; see #Bookofwhy. Several economists indeed Tweeted that things are waking up, and the paper by Abadie-Cataneo affirms it. Still, the editors of Econometrica do not see urgency in teaching readers what identification and endogeneity are from a causal lens.
