@yudapearl @sadneurons @f2harrell @DrewLevy I agree, the term “spurious correlations” creates a lot of confusion. In epidemiology, we usually use it for “non-causal” associations (e.g. created by an open backdoor path or a controlled collider). But “spurious” means fake, false, invalid or not justified etc. 1/3
