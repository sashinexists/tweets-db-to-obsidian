@yudapearl @ESteyerberg @LinkedIn @Lester_Domes @MariaGlymour @NP_Jewell Your solution works if the following is the case.
1) You have a group of students allocated at random to one of two diets
2) It is noticed that mean initial weight varies from one diet to another
3) You want to correct for this.
However, that's not the story in The Book of Why.
