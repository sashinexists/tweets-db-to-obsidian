@yudapearl @PHuenermund @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal I keep telling you what the added wisdom is: there is no unique DAG for any given problem. Depending on what procedure you use to build the DAG you will get a different answer. So, what procedures lead you to make defensible assumptions?
