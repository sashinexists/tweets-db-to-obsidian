@Eule_Geheule @jeremyfreese @CharlieSeguin @yudapearl Agreed, they're complementary. But, @yudapearl has nice debates with p.o. folks about this (including recent tweets!). Especially appreciated his defense of non-manipulable causes, for example. Don't see p.o. folks developing concepts quite like portability either.
