@RWJE_BA @PavlosMsaouel @stephensenn @yudapearl @ESMDcan123 @f2harrell @eliasbareinboim Bias can come from violations of causal ID assumptions. I agree no amount of fancy modeling can help you if you, say, have ignorability violations. But even if ID assumptions hold, you can get bias from misspecification. That's partially where nonparametric Bayes can help.
