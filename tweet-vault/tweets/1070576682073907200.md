@EpiEllie @robertwplatt @zshahn @_MiguelHernan I am not aware of a crispier  separation between "causal effects we can estimate from data and those we canâ€™t" than the do-calculus. Are you? So you should be the first to ask: How does it work? What have I missed by ignoring it? Ask, and your "useful separation" will be granted.
