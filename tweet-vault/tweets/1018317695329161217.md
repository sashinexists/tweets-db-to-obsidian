@f2harrell @yudapearl If the problem we are discussing happens even asymptotically, obviously, it'll compound, and be even harder under finite samples. Anything new here? Still, I assume u are not proposing we should give up on a fundamental question (principled heterogeneity) just bec. it's hard..
