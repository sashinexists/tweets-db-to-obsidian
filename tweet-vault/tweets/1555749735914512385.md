@MeganTStevenson @PHuenermund @paulgp @dlmillimet @pietrobiroli @yudapearl @eliasbareinboim Sure but we know the changing decision is made "because of skin color" since we randomized that - there can be different mechanisms for that effect of course

Maybe a reconciliation is to talk about disparate treatment/impact in terms of a specific characteristic like skin color?
