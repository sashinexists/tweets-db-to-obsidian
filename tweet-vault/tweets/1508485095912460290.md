@RWJE_BA @yudapearl @soboleffspaces @noah_greifer @causalinf @EpiEllie @bveg3 Not at all. It would indicate that I don’t know everything about RCT’s. One example would of knowledge on RCT’s would refute your assumption. If anything, not answering my question indicates you don’t have a response. Cause if you did, why wouldn’t you just answer with that?
