@78tiger @blakeflayton The rumor I mentioned was, of course, poetic. But not too far off. To the best of my recollection, it was @IfNotNowOrg that said Kaddish for both "Israeli and Hamas victims" in the latest Gazza clash -- any distinction between good and evil makes them feel too "ethno-centric".
