@yudapearl @kareem_carr If "Y=1" is "the water molecules move in particular way D" and "Y=0" that they do something else (stay put, move in a different way...), then "X=1" must be something like "the moon has mass M and orbit O" and "X=0" that this is not the case (M or O diff., or both). &lt;cont.&gt;
