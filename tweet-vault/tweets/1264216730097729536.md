Our well-intentioned funding agencies are partly responsible for this mis-balanced mis-investment. They all want &amp; fund "explainable AI" "robust AI" "life-long learning" etc etc. forgetting that, once projects are run by traditionally-trained PI's they end up "more of the same." https://t.co/utzcZGSoCm
