@yudapearl @HarryDCrane And if I understand fully...a population-level question is best addressed ‘impersonally’ via causal inference. And beyond that, an individual’s-eye-view (most impt bc we’re all individuals &amp; people that care about individuals) is best considered via counterfactual thought.
