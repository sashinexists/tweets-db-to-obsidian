@dchackethal @SamHarrisOrg @yudapearl I don't think there is much difference between induction and (Popperian) explanation.

But there are multiple kinds of induction or explanations:
- statistical
- logical
- causal/system
- control/goal/person

All set expectations, but only statistical has a black swan problem.
