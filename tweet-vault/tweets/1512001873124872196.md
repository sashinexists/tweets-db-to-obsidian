To all lovers of counterfactual reasoning, this Passover song, Dayenu, has 14 nested counterfactuals in it, and it ends with one big thanks-giving praise: How grateful we should be that all those possible worlds have NOT materialized, and we can enjoy our actual world.
Amen! https://t.co/eLXr5OFC8p
