@mushfiq_econ @Jabaluck @amitabhchandra2 Even the most tool-neutral philosophers cannot but notice  that DAGs are second language in epidemiology and taboo in economics. Some attribute it to differences in research questions, some to types of data. Others, me included, to social  &amp; academic leadership. #Bookofwhy
