@yudapearl @Susan_Athey @joshgans I love that "empirical applications" is in quotes (these darn economists who think there is an "external world" worth "studying"). Ways to judge: are your assumptions consistent with institutional and contextual knowledge? Do they pass placebo tests? Overidentifying restrictions?
