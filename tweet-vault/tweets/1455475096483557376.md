@annareitman @MassadJoseph @SandraZaloun Fascinating findings, but genetic lineage is only one component of "indigeneity". An Irish native who serves in IDF, sings "Yerushalayim" and celebrates Hanuka in Modiin is no less indigenous to the land than @MassadJoseph for whom the pre-1900 history of the land means nothing.
