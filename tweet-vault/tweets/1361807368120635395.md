@yudapearl @dmckenzie001 @jenniferdoleac @PHuenermund @causalinf I think you're just misunderstanding.

If I give a human two DAGs to represent a given situation one of which is quite implausible (e.g. it has an arrow from umbrellas to clouds), humans can determine that this arrow is implausible.

Can you build an AI that can do this?
