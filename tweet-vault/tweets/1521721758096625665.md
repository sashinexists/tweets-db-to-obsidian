@BernieSanders @ninaturner @SummerForPA @NidaAllam @JCisnerosTX Hard to swallow, but @ninaturner lost because  she is associated with you, Bernie, and you have designated Linda Sarsour and James Zobgy as your advisors on Israel. You are a liability, Bernie, unless you come out strongly against BDS, very strongly, before November.
