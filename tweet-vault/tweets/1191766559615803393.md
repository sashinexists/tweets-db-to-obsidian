@AdanZBecerra1 @fledglingStat @robertstats @yudapearl So. Suppose you have two estimates that a priori are unbiased but disagree because, you know, like it or not, random variation is a thing. Now you are going to combine them. Do you really think it makes no difference what the standard errors are?
