@EpiEllie @Canadian_JACD @yudapearl @_MiguelHernan I haven't heard about this rule for DAG construction before, ie, variables that one wants to measure the effect are treated differently during construction than other vars. Is there any reference or theoretical rationale for it? Otherwise, it seems to undermine your point, no?
