@yudapearl @artistexyz @causalinf @unifr Agree when it comes to obs studies! But in my example of randomization within strata of pre-treatment X, M-bias cannot occur, as the treatment within strata is by design not associated with unobservables. The DAG is X-&gt;D-&gt;Y, where X-Y might be confounded, but D||(Y(1),Y(0))|X
