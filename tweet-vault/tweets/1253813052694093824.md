@autoregress @Jabaluck @eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @PACESconsulting @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @HeerJeet Not perfectly, but if we can name some of these things,  maybe we can consider stratifying by air quality, which is easier to measure than other attributes. Regarding eating, since people do not take this into account when eating, as long as "poor people" food and "rich people"..
