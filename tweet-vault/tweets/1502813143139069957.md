@yudapearl @wellingmax Convolutional NNs mix together a notion of scale separation (w/ pooling) &amp; translational symmetry (w/ convolutions). The expected properties in the data are only approximate &amp; the implementation in the architecture isn't perfect, but it still biases towards relevant solutions
