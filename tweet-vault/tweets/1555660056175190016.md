@yudapearl @instrumenthull @PHuenermund @dlmillimet @paulgp @pietrobiroli I am curious about one implication of DAGs. No snark here. Am I wrong in concluding that any DAG in which race or gender is not a descendant of some other variable implies that the causal effect of race or gender is nonparametrically identifiable?
