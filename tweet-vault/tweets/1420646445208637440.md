No one screams "antisemitism"; the scream is: "thoughtlessness". If Ben &amp; Gerry think Israel can defend itself better without controlling the West Bank, it is a valid military opinion. But their decision to criminalize in public those of opposite opinion is careless at best. https://t.co/2MFuCnS6lN
