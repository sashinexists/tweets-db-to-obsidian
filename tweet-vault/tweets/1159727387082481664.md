@maximananyev @Jabaluck @yudapearl @causalinf @steventberry @paulgp @lewbel @Undercoverhist But "Quasi experiments" require no fewer aasumptions than DAGs. 

Here again vagueness- the misleading use of the word "experiment", to which a fuzzy and infinitely flexible qualifier is added- fools people into believeing they are making fewer assumptions than they really are.
