@yudapearl @twainus @yhazony @ylecun @GaryMarcus @tdietterich @rodneyabrooks @lexfridman @haldaume3 @StanfordHAI @albertwenger @Joi Could I ask you the same? Based on your long career, what would be a must-read book or paper not to miss? The older the better but if possible no or little mathematics, as I do not speak that language well. Thanks for the (short) conversation by the way!
