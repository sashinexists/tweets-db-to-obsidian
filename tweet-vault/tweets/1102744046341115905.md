@yudapearl @generativist @visakanv @girlziplocked Okay. I'll bite!
1. I didn't know about SCMâ€”Is it different from DAGs+do calculus?
2. These overlap a lot. I don't know enough for a complete delineation.
3. The g-methods by Robins and Hernan are taught here at Harvard. They estimate effects which epidemiologists care about.
