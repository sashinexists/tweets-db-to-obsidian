@yudapearl @stephensenn @AndrewPGrieve @PavlosMsaouel @f2harrell @smueller @ChristosArgyrop As I understand @yudapearl, RCT uses "unnatural" selection of units whereas observational data preserve the variability of paths in the effect production. Combining the natural and "unnatural" selection supplies estimates for his counterfactualsâ€¦
