@omaclaren @Jabaluck @alexpghayes @steventberry @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @yudapearl @MariaGlymour @autoregress I'm not sure I'd call a conservation law a causal assumption, since it is time-symmetric. Conceptually I think of causality as a higher order phenomena that can be thought to arise from "coarse graining", much like the 2nd law of thermodynamics.
