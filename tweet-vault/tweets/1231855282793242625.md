@HannesMalmberg1 @steventberry I am still not clear if there is anything new in p. 97 that econ students can use, or is it all 3rd-week freshman class. I was ready to offer a big apology for wrongly believing in the former, but I am not getting a definitive affirmation of the freshman model. Help! #Bookofwhy
