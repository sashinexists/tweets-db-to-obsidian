@yudapearl @Jabaluck @KordingLab @maximananyev @PHuenermund You persist in discussing statistics as a monolithic organization with a single opinion.  This is neither realistic nor helpful. 

There are plenty (e.g., me) who have welcomed the SCM into stats, though perhaps not to the extent you would like. Am I an acceptor or a resistor?
