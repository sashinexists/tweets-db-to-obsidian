@Jabaluck @btshapir @paulnovosad @yudapearl I have a candidate example that is worth looking: the literature on wage gap/discrimination. From what I have read so far, it can benefit from the new mediation literature and results, even for something as simple defining the research questions/estimands appropriately.
