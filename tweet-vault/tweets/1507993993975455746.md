I like the paradigm shift from the "3 No's" of Khartoum to "3 Yes's of #AbrahamAccords that we are about to witness tomorrow, at the Negev Summit. Only dinosaurs old enough to remember the Khartoum's 3 No's can appreciate the devastating effect it has had on the soul of peace. https://t.co/McPqQEdsDy
