@stephensenn @RonKenett @learnfromerror I still can't see how John Nedler could distinguish a good block (say "age") from its proxy (say "reading level") lacking mathematical notation in 1965. Moreover, how could he possibly PROVE that blocking on age improves precision, when blocking on "reading" may not. #Bookofwhy
