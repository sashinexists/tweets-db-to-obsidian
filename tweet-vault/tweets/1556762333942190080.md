@EpiEllie @pietrobiroli @PHuenermund @instrumenthull @paulgp @dlmillimet @eliasbareinboim What makes you jump to the conclusion that I cannot present a clear explanation? The Natural Direct Effect is much easier to explain then the Controlled Direct Effect. And, as we both know, explanations have nothing to do with estimation. So what made you jump to such conclusion?
