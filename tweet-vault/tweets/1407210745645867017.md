@testy_joebob @DJonahue @SarahKSilverman @ZionessMovement I have yet to see a 20th C. atrocity NOT committed in the name of "fighting against" some "injustice". The MASTER litmus test to separate a true fighter from an imposter fighter is whether the denial of Israel's legitimacy is named as part of the fought-against "injustices".
