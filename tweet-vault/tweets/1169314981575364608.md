@PHuenermund @yudapearl @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal You said you think DAGs are not path-dependent in the way I said. I am amazed you believe this so I think I might be misunderstanding the empirical content of your claim. What experiment would convince you that you are mistaken?
