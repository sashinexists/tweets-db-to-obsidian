@steventberry @yudapearl @causalinf @PHuenermund @econbookclub @Chris_Auld @analisereal @jdramirezc @PhilHaile Steven, if you took a demand model and replaced price on the right hand side with the determinants of price, would you still call the resulting equation a demand model? I wouldn't. In this example, I'd say the behavioral demand function is (at least part of) the structural model.
