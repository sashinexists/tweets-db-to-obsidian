@eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @mendel_random @jwbelmon I don't think one problem is easier and one is harder - they are just different. One is abstract and theoretical, the other is practical and pragmatic. Each should inspire the other. My personal preference is for the second, but I see plenty of value in the first.
