@_limbs_ @loudquack @shravanvasishth Well put! Here I did not imply deliberately avoiding causality for some udlterior motives. I attributed the missed opportunity to (1) their justified excitement over the discovery of correlation and (2) lacking a language to go beyond it. Deliberate avoidance was practiced later.
