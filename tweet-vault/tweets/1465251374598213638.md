@CausalHuber @artistexyz @causalinf @unifr This is an argument I have had with Imbens since day one: Is transparency of assumptions a matter of "getting used to" or an objective feature of the language in which the assumptions are expressed? Do you know anyone who has "gotten used to" judging {Y(0), Y(1)} || D| X  ?
