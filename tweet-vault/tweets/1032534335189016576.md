@rjmori @PHuenermund @Noahpinion This looks familiar!!! Its the definition of (nonparametric) identifiability from Causality (2000)!- Thanks for sharing! Sadly, even the most recent survey paper on econometric identification that I reviewed does not provide a definition, not to mention a solution. #Bookofwhy
