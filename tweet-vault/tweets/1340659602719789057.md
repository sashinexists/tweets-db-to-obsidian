@VC31415 @DonskerClass @lewbel @PhilHaile @steventberry Two comments. (1) Having unobserved variables 
(= functions) in the diagram does not make it non-standard DAGs. (2) It is possible to interpret D and S as actual demand and supply, and the price-determining agent as responding to S &amp; D and minimizing cost of inventory S-D.
