@Jabaluck @yudapearl @metrics52 This paragraph startled me at first, but then I thought that what's being "automated" here is about as relevant to causal inference as inverting matrices, that is, it makes calculation easier than doing it by hand. But having the right "model" -- that's the hard part. https://t.co/yytkYsjcDN
