James Zogby @jjz1600 can't reconcile to the fact that "separation" based on likelihood of violence and past behavior is not "apartheid" but first principle of law enforcement. Airlines act the same, when a passenger starts cursing the crew, let alone assaulting other passengers. https://t.co/qPdvtIU3N4
