@yudapearl Thanks Judea. And we’d be delighted to have you visit any time. It would be an honour, and we’d ensure the arrangements made it comfortable. By the way, the banner photo on my Twitter is Boole’s own signature on his own copy of The Laws of Thought. @UCC was Queen’s College then. https://t.co/F5tOPFKnB5
