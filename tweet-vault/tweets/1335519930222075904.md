@yudapearl @PhilHaile ...yes, it would be indeed helpful for the interaction and the dialogue that you try to work out a real-life example, entirely, with your method, comparing with our structural methods (I mean "modus operandi" throughout)... Co-authoring with econs would prolly help in that task.
