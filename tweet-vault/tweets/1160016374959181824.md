@lewbel @steventberry @Jabaluck @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @MariaGlymour @autoregress I must be missing something important. If the "reduced form" is descriptive, how can it impose untestable assumptions? More basic: Does the "reduce form" preserve the structural assumptions carried by the structural model of which it is a "reduced form"? #Bookofwhy
