@djinnome @chuston1776 @yudapearl @DeepMind @ma_parent @johnurbanik @osazuwa @PayamMousavi4 I’m curious—now that you have worked through the toy example, how do you judge trees on easiness of: (i) specifying the model? (ii) deriving testable implications of the model? For instance, it seems that conditional independence only shows up in the numbers not in the structure?
