@yudapearl @JNS_org 2. His comparison of apartheid to Israel surely rubs Israelis the wrong way. But to say "Arabs within Israel are not denied equal rights under the law" ignores those in the West Bank &amp; Gaza I presume he referred to. They live a life of misery. Many Israelis share his concerns.
