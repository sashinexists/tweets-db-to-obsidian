@yudapearl @soboleffspaces @AndrewPGrieve @PavlosMsaouel @f2harrell @smueller @ChristosArgyrop But there is an inverse problem to this, of course,
The causal literature uses 'covariance' very carelessly and does not seem to be aware that two variables can have differen variances, covariances and hence correlations at different levels.
