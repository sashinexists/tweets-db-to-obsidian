@yudapearl @GaryMarcus @mpshanahan @_rockt @AvilaGarcez @luislamb @AnimaAnandkumar @Susan_Athey @metrics52 How correlated is risk taking with smoking? How much does itcause cancer? Bothtwrms we can meaningfully estimate. Omitted variable bias can allow us to conclude that risk taking won't explain away the correlation. Smoking causes cancer 2/2.
