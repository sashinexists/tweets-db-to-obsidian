@yudapearl @danijarh Now, we see 100 points of observational data, but it looks like this:
50x: R(&lt;S,C&gt;, A1) = 0
50x: R(&lt;S,C&gt;, A2) = 0
and 100 randomized trials:
50x: R(&lt;S,R&gt;, A1) = .5
50x: R(&lt;S,R&gt;, A2) = .5
Let's say Joe is a history buff, H. He needs to select his policy:
Ï€(&lt;S,C,H&gt;) = ?
