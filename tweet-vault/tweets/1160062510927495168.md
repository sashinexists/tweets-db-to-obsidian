@fuzzydunlop123 @IvanWerning @steventberry @Jabaluck @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @MariaGlymour @autoregress I agree here, "model" cannot replace "structural model," because statisticians think that the assumption of  normality is a "model" and some MHE students think that a "regression equation" is a "model". The word "structural" tells us what assumptions it carries. #Bookofwhy
