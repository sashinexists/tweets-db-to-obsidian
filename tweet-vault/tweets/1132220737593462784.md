@yudapearl @mszargar @AsraNomani If you genuinely believe in two states for two people, you would make a strong call against Trumpâ€™s US Embassy move, call for Israel to withdraw from all occuped territory (E. Jerusalem, WB, Gaza, Golan), and equal rights for all citizens of Israel. This is what BDS calls for.
