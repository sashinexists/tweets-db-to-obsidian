@BreskinEpi @eliasbareinboim @EpiEllie @l__ds @malco_barrett @NeuroStats @ken_rothman One  reason computer scientists are baffled by PIEs is that, recognizing
that "A and B only cause Y when both are present‚Äù  (given a bunch of N PIEs) amounts to solving an N-variable SAT problem, which is  hard. Can PIE do what math says we can't? #Bookofwhy #Epibookclub
