@federicarusso @soboleffspaces @dylanarmbruste3 @causalinf @Jon_Williamson_ I think people are asking whether Structural Causal Models (SCM), which are known for their super explanatory power, would qualify as "mechanism" in your vocabulary. Another way to pose the question:
Would we lose anything by talking about "functions" instead of "mechanisms"?
