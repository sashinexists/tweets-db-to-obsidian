@AdanZBecerra1 @yudapearl Thank you!! I am always honoured when I do get "coverage". Yesterday gave opening plenary at Nordic Epi Conference. The scandinavians invite me quite regularly- and are a really good bunch of epidemiologists. America is tougher... perhaps academic culture encourages fixed views?
