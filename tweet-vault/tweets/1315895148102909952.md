@nyarlathotepesq @Jabaluck "economics classic", "parlor game", "sophomoric", "textbook" are common expressions I am hearing again and again, but no solution to my question: "Take your model, which confounder can you add without spoiling identifiability?" Same with "endogeneity". "Classic" with no solution.
