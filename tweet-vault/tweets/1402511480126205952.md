@cadillacmuzicc @Observe89314530 @DrMikeH49 @surgeryontv @Eve_Barlow You are wrong again. Judaism is "people first and religion second" (eg. Ruth: "your people is mine,  your God is mine}). Zionism is all about "we", as long as "we" includes "me", not replace "me." 
WE = "Equally legitimate and equally indigenous"
