@eliasbareinboim @statwonk @yudapearl @PHuenermund OK cool - key point is that these models fit nicely into a HM framework, as is done in the statistics book by Cressie and Wikle. Pearl asked for a book where models that went beyond data are given. So I gave this reference! Do you agree this is reasonable?
