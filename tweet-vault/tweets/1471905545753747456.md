@stephensenn @soboleffspaces @AndrewPGrieve @PavlosMsaouel @f2harrell @smueller @ChristosArgyrop I am thrilled by the prospect of integrating causal and DOE matters but my stumbling block has been absence of a language. For example, do we have a mathematical expression for "blocking", or, what should the world be like for a given DOE to be more effective than another?
