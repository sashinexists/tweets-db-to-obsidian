@cubic_logic @gottfriedmath @sadneurons @f2harrell @DrewLevy "Fooled by attempting" requires some de-cryption. Do you mean "you can't estimate them" or, "even if you estimate them, you won't get what you want."?  If the latter, we need a description of what you want -- thus far missing from our discussion &amp; we can't continue without one.
