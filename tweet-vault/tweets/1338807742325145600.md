I'll be sending this #Hanukah video to my family, so that, tomorrow night, when we zoom-light the 5th candle, we will listen again by the message of Chanukah that we sang since kindergarten: 
A miracle has not happened to us,
We carved the rock till we bled
And there was light. https://t.co/5mlJw1s2sR
