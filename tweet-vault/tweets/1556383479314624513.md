@SAFECUNY @CUNYkcc @CUNYKCCPRES The litmus test on whether @CUNYKCCPRES really means to "address it" is whether she spells out what "it" means. If she says "antisemitism", forget it, she seeks a license for inaction. If she says "anti-Zionism", give her a chance, but make sure she spells it on CUNY's  website.
