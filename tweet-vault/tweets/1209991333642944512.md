@BethCarey12 @GaryMarcus @tdietterich @yudapearl I believe that DL (defined as gradient-based learning applied to networks of differentiable modules), is here to stay.
So yes: I think DL is the right scientific model.
More accurately: DL is part of the solution.
Though obviously, its current incarnations are insufficient.
