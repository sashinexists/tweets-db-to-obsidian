@Jabaluck @fuzzydunlop123 @erinhengel @PHuenermund And you insist you could have run a similar conversation with Angrist using the language of potential outcomes, where even "bad controls" are subject to embarrassment. BTW, is anyone writing the history of "bad controls" in pre-Telescopic econometric literature? #Bookofwhy
