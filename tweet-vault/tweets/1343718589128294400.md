@lihua_lei_stat @artistexyz @ShalitUri @VC31415 @CasualBrady There is another twist here. Suppose there are two distinct estimands for the some query (say two distinct sufficient sets) one contains zero-probability conditioning sets, the other does not. Is the query identifiable? If so, do we need to examine all estimands before deciding?
