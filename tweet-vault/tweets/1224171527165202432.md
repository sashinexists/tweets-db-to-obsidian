@yudapearl @athos_damiani @agpatriota In the Simpson's paradox example, causal understanding simplifies the discussion in two simple graphs, as shown in the #bookofwhy. It's really useful, and beautiful and clear! But one could explain it in an equivalent without using DAGs... This is why I prefer "useful" ;) 2/2
