But, if the cause must happen first and the cause &amp; effect must coincide in space, how does causation “transfer” to the effect? 

Maybe spatial adjacency also requires temporal adjacency — that is, maybe cause and effect have to occur at the *same* moment in time for causation? https://t.co/K1ShaLitdU
