@Chris_Auld @PhilHaile @steventberry @lewbel @causalinf @PHuenermund @econbookclub @analisereal @jdramirezc While it's true that structural equations can model a decision maker "Behavior", including actions and explorations, the word "Behavioral" has an unfortunate association with Skinnerian "Behaviorism", so it may be misleading. As to "causal" why not define it formally?
