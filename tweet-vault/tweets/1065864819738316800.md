@jasonhartford @dustinvtran @zacharylipton @CsabaSzepesvari @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @yudapearl @ShalitUri 5/5 Back to our original Q: what about RL? Assume Z can be random&amp; the do(Z)-dist computed. The goal may be not to know about Z, but what would have happened when X is intervened upon. Fisher cannot help here, but, it turns out, the tools of CI are very suitable for this setting.
