@AndersHuitfeldt @yudapearl Perhaps one of the surprises of transportability theory is that thereâ€™s no way of making a claim about a causal effect without assumptions (stronger than the ones related to internal validity). Model-based = assumptions, both from obs as well as experimental data. No escape.
