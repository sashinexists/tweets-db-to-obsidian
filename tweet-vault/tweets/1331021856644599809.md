@Blattberg @anniefofani @AndrewPessin @EinatWilf The words "favor the interests" make it  sound immoral. I would say: Nationalism is an ideology that leverages the commonalities of the national community to create a cohesive and functioning society. Take US, we leverage our memories of Lincoln, MLK etc. to function as community
