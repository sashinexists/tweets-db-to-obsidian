@PHuenermund @dlmillimet @snavarrol @yudapearl @a40ruhr @causalinf @PossebomVitor @nickchk If you use an identification strategy where it's easy to come up with plausible alternative stories, your identification strategy IS bad. Do we know you got the wrong answer? No. Do we have any reason to think you got the right answer? Also no.
