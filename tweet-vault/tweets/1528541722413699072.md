To readers requesting good books on the history of the Yishuv, I am recommending Anita Shapira "Israel: A history" (2012, Brandeis U.)
https://t.co/U3vX4vq3N9
Shapira is a first class, authoritative historian, who understands the pulse of history through its sources. @noatishby https://t.co/dGvRFntJB3
