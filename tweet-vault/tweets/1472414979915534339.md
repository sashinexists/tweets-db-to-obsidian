My apology was formulated on October 11, 1947, when Azzam Pasha (Secretary General of the Arab League) declared: "a war of extermination and momentous massacre which will be spoken of like the Mongolian massacre and the Crusades." I was only 11, but my parents took him seriously. https://t.co/fdM0mRnszt
