@RWJE_BA @soboleffspaces @f2harrell @stephensenn @yudapearl @smueller @ChristosArgyrop @AndrewPGrieve Physician-scientists typically make as strong or stronger counterfactual assumptions in our clinical decisions and/or lab research. Also note that EBM assumptions can sometimes be even stronger. Making causal assumptions explicit allows us to critique and improve our inferences.
