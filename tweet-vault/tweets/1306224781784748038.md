@PHuenermund @julianschuess @analisereal @nickchk @yudapearl What I wanted to point out is that if the quantity of interest is the ATE, as in the model you rightly suggest, then the CATE can be very different from that. And the closer Z is to a necessary and sufficient condition for X, the more than CATE can diverge from the ATE.
