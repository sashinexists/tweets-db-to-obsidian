@GivingTools @yudapearl @KetchupEconomi1 @sterndavidi It’s only AEA I think. I feel like I need to ask @JakeVigdor though bc he’s dig into the finances of the AEA carefully a few times. Jake, maybe I heard a bad rumor but do we know the honorariums paid to the AEA editors? It’s not a single line item I don’t think.
