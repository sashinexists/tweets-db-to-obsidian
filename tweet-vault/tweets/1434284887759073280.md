@yudapearl @JaapAbbring @Chris_Auld @PhilHaile @VC31415 @DonskerClass @steventberry The general point is that Rust’s model is a classic example in economics of a highly parameterized, behavior based structural model. It’s identification depends crucially on the parameterization of the model, and so SCM methodology is not of much help.
