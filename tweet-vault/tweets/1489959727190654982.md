@soboleffspaces @yudapearl @causalinf @nickchk @EpiEllie I missed the part of #studyingCausality when @yudapearl is discussing Lewis’s theory of cf-s in relation to his, maybe this will help me understand why stick to Lewis here at all, I mean there’s no need for a historical pedigree of an otherwise winning theory, names don’t matter https://t.co/WwcQZUBuM3
