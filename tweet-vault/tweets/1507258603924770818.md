@soboleffspaces @yudapearl @causalinf @EpiEllie I firmly believe the ITE is impossible to calculate. Unless one has collected all *effect modifiers*, not just confounders, the ITE remains elusive and can even be in the opposite direction of the CATE given the confounders. https://t.co/jzmrUlZH88 @bveg3
