@EpiEllie @PHuenermund @yudapearl 2/2 I can "imagine" an intervention (as u put), while other variable does not have due to my lack of imagination. Is Nature working differently in these 2 settings? This suggests that when I wake up tomorrow more inspired, some variables will start having "well-defined effects"!
