@VC31415 @JaapAbbring @edwinleuven My view differs: potential outcomes, hence Supply and Demand functions, are products of SEM, by definition. And I would not call SEM history "fine" if its practitioners can't tell, even today, what the testable implications are of a model, or which parameter is estimable by OLS.
