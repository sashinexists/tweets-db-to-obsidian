@dylanarmbruste3 @yudapearl This is exactly what happened during my second lecture introductory statistics. I asked that question, prof said: "that's causal inference, we don't cover that in this course." 

That was the end of that. Pure frequentism from there on out. Bayes was never even mentioned.
