@VladZamfir @yudapearl @oliverbeige @timelessdev @cryptoecongames Bayesian concept is much deeper as it is seems to be if think over it. Additionally you use it every day as an applications. For example behind any Kalman filter (GPS) is just the plain Bayesian rule of updating hypothesis. So there is no problem with Bayesianism.
