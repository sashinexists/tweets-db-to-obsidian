@Corey_Yanofsky @Lester_Domes @stephensenn @omaclaren A partial meeting of minds was achieved here, on Twitter, when my mind realized that what Senn objects to is the perfect alignment of the two ellipses, which would rarely occur in real life. This I consider to be orthogonal to Lord's question: "Who is right?" #Bookofwhy
