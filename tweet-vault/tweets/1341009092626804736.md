@yudapearl @VC31415 @Chris_Auld @DonskerClass @lewbel @PhilHaile @steventberry So, start with Sec 7.2.1's model of a market's equilibrium. Suppose the government steps in and monopolizes supply, fixing the quantity Q at q_0 and selling it for the max consumers are willing to pay. How do you calculate the new equilibrium price using Sec 7.2.1's causal model?
