@AsraNomani @fcpsnews @Harvard @yudapearl I know all about the Jewish quotas, Asra. &amp; I'm married to an Asian American so I know about the history of Asian exclusion. But I've also read the court decisions. Harvard admits many more Asians than most elite pvt colleges. &amp; admissions is less &amp; less about test scores.
