@yudapearl @DKedmey @DavidDeutschOxf @EinatWilf @sapinker @LRNR agree w the second part. but i do think that, esp in other monotheistic cultures, the very existence/persistence of judaism criticized revealed truths. and it continues into modern secular times: freud, einstein challenged deeply imbedded attitudes.
