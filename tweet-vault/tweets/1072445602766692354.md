Thanks, Frank, for posting @DrewLevy illuminating review of #Bookofwhy. Even those who read the book cover to cover will find it valuable to recapture the spirit of the book and its key messages. I especially enjoyed "Why do the heathen rage?" on the psychology of the resistance. https://t.co/Fkq3x2sBdr
