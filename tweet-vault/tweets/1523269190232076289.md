@AdanZBecerra1 @_MiguelHernan @EpiEllie @ProfMattFox @MariaGlymour It's page 117, sorry. It says: In the case where the node A has a parent, A has to “listen” to its parent before deciding on its own state.
"Listening" is one metaphor, another is: "The sources of variations in A are its parents." A third  invokes hypothetical interventions.
