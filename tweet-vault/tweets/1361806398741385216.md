@Jabaluck @dmckenzie001 @jenniferdoleac @PHuenermund @causalinf The disappointment is mutual. Instead of presenting ONE model that is BOADER than the DAGs variety, you hurl "self promotion" accusations at those who attempt to explain what the logic of causal inference can and cannot do for  building convincing arguments for an estimator.
