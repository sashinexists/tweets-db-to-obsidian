@alexis_andreyev @SAFECUNY @CUNYkcc @CUNYKCCPRES @ChancellorCUNY The honest answer to this question is: Israel has now ample evidence showing that this would not end Palestinian's inbred commitment to the destruction of Israel. As Biden said: "I've been around the ME, and am yet to meet ONE Palestinian willing to accept Israel."
