@zakkohane @DShaywitz @bariweiss @slsatel @MartinSGaynor @NoahCRothman @YKleinHalevi This has nothing to do with antisemitism. It has to do with the fact that we don't have a word to label this kind of moral deformity, and Jewish organizations like Hartman Inst., @ADL, @AJC, even @bariweiss refrain from using the only word we do have: Zionophobia.
