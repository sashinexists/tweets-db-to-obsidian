@Jabaluck @yudapearl @PHuenermund @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal Yes its important to collect and adjust for all possible confounders. But also note,you are calling some vars confounders but they are actually mediators.income cannot confound race-&gt; mortality association because it's on causal pathway.
