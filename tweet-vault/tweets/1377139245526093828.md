@JonSchw73589513 @vishakh Sure. The ideas I borrowed from GSC are well documented in Causality (2000) and credited in @Bookofwhy (see page 244). Maudlin imagined some 1980's works which presumably could have saved me years of labor and which were NOT cited or credited. I invite readers to name any.
