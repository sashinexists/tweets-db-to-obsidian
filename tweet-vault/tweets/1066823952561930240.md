@junzhez @Abel_TorresM @yudapearl @eliasbareinboim @jasonhartford @dustinvtran @zacharylipton @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @ShalitUri I feel that to win the hearts of RL researchers  a problem that RL researchers may care about and where CI gives a nontrivial edge should be worked out (robotics, OR..). I know a lot of people who are thinking about this. If anyone listening has already an example, I am all ears.
