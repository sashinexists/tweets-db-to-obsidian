@junzhez @Abel_TorresM @yudapearl @eliasbareinboim @jasonhartford @dustinvtran @zacharylipton @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @ShalitUri I feel that to win the hearts of RL researchers  a problem that RL researchers may care about and where CI gives a nontrivial edge should be worked out (robotics, OR..).
