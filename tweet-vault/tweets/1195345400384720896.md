A LOADED question to @amitabhchandra2. We have had a lively discussion here on Twitter whether economics is more insular than other disciplines. Do you think econ. editors are doing enough to expose readers to emerging methodologies that neighboring disciplines have found useful? https://t.co/lBrIJ97WXs
