@analisereal @autoregress @Jabaluck @yudapearl @PACESconsulting @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @HeerJeet I appreciate you guys engaging for 5 mins in this modeling exercise where the backdoor, IV &amp; even a much more sophisticated hypothesis just raised seem to be overly simplistic. This seems to imply, logically, that not all causal problems in the world map to the BD and IV, right?
