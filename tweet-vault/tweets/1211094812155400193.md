@yudapearl @GaryMarcus @mpshanahan @_rockt @AvilaGarcez @luislamb @AnimaAnandkumar @Susan_Athey @metrics52 I am sorry if I misinterpreted. But it did not feel sincere to me. Instead your comments here and in other places felt like an ongoing dismissal of the other intellectual traditions in the area of causal inference. Tell me what you like about them?
