@stephensenn @yudapearl @f2harrell @soboleffspaces @SMuellerLab We havenâ€™t touched any other special or more complicated trial designs.  I have some sympathy that terms like "cluster" and "non-concurrent" and "within study" are tricky, I'm not sure why the burden is on everyone else to explain these things in your preferred notation.
