@PHuenermund @dlmillimet @paulgp @PEngzell @patrickaturley 2/ has nothing to do with interpretation or with coefficients. Also, in the IV model the IV variable is the only "exogenous" variable. Finally, in a regression model  "exogeneity" is not defined. The glossary seems like an endless job, but where would we be w/o it?#Bookofwhy
