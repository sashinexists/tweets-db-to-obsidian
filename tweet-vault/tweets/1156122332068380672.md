@maximananyev @Jabaluck @fuzzydunlop123 @erinhengel @PHuenermund Apropos:The more explicit the assumption, the more
criticism it invites, for it triggers a richer space
of alternative scenarios in which the assumption may
fail. Researchers prefer therefore to declare threats in
public and make assumptions in private.  https://t.co/dEPwcuLbPS
