@fuiud @CarterPaddy @Jabaluck I dont buy the "reality of applied work" as an excuse for not trying synthetic problems, whose correct answers can be obtained either analytically or by simulation. I would love to learn new attitudes to external validity issues, explained from scratch. I'm listening. #Bookofwhy
