@MariaGlymour @ProfMattFox Yes, DAGs offers a meaningful language for encoding and scrutinizing assumptions (there might be others) and, once in DAG form, we can derive conditional exchangeability conclusions if they are needed for identification. What we cannot afford is direct judgment of cond. exchang.
