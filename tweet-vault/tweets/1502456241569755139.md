@david_lagnado @nerdy_grad @AndrewPGrieve @suiss70 @miquelporta I didn't think anyone would deem me capable of such trickery. Plus disseminating the ideas of Personalized Decisions is of much higher priority than promoting a book. The former has so many paradigms to shift that I can't resist linking to it again, here: https://t.co/rGHIc9kH0O
