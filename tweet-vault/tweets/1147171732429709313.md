@EpiDancer @MariaGlymour @autoregress Definitely the main sticking point is the BDC, but what I don’t understand is why econs don’t also see that as a sticking point against IVs etc. The claim is so often that there will *always* be an unknown confounder, so why wouldn’t the instrument also always be confounded?
