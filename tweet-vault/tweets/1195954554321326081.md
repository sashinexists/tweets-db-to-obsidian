@RonKenett @stephensenn @learnfromerror @RonKenett. Why is it that design experts tend to refer me to authorities when I ask "what makes 'age' a better block than say 'hair color'" Why cant I find one to tell me what a 'good block' means to him/her PERSONALLY, or how they explain it to their students? Shy? #Bookofwhy
