@yudapearl @PHuenermund @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal You see this as a non-issue because you have never tried to make assumptions in a real-world example. In your toy problems, your assumptions are true by fiat, and so you assume away the most difficult part of causal inference.
