@stephensenn @yudapearl @ESMDcan123 @f2harrell @eliasbareinboim The most powerful new tool developed by the statistical world IMO is Bayesian nonparametrics. Not yet essential, but integration with causal inference, e.g., for estimating dynamic treatment regimes will be impactful. Excellent review by @StableMarkets ðŸ‘‰ https://t.co/eR3Z4Ns9zW
