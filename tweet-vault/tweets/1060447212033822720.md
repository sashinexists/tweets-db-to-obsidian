@MelMitchell1 @adibzaman @eliasbareinboim @tdietterich I look forward to reading about causal models in your upcoming book. Can you share basic ideas on how you envision the building of those models from data, and how they are encoded, once built. Have recent developments in #causalinference been of some help to you? #Bookofwhy
