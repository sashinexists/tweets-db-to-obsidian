@eliasbareinboim @EpiEllie @iwashyna @yudapearl @Amy_Bohnert @Research_ICU @NEJM @_MiguelHernan I guess that's maybe why @yudapearl is thinking that "target-trial" is somehow associated to covariate-specific effect. P(Y_do(obesity)) would be inconsistent in PO, but that could be addressed by having a more specific query P(Y | do(obesity), gene_z, no_exercise)?
