@yudapearl @LeCun Many showed #induction machines don't predict rare, unseen or novel behaviors: Popper, Talleb, Robert Rosen (anticipatory systems), Howard Pattee (papers on modelling &amp; measurement problem). Indeed that's why vertebrates use #adaptiveimmunity: to predict never observed pathogens.
