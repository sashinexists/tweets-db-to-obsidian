@yudapearl @mjdramstead @Prof_Livengood I would be interested in seeing a response by the FEP community to Pearl’s “Bayesianism and Causality, or, Why I am Only a Half-Bayesian” paper, and whether his current thoughts on this are relevant to active inference formulations. Perhaps this has been addressed elsewhere?
