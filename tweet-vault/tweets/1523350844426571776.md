@yudapearl @hmatejx @RWJE_BA But there is a very simple and obvious difference in purpose
1) Making causal comparisons (e.g. as in experiments)
2) Describing a population (e.g. as in surveys)
Have you no interest in understanding whether the assumptions you make are reasonable &amp; how will you check?
