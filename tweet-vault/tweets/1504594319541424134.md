@yudapearl @stephensenn @soboleffspaces @JFronczekMD @EpiEllie @f2harrell @ADAlthousePhD @artistexyz @statsepi @GuyattGH @GRADE_WG But you are modelling mathematically based on CI the assessment of treatment efficacy &amp; itâ€™s application to treatment decisions for individuals. Inevitably such modelling makes many unrecognised assumptions buried in equations (eg collapsible RD &amp; not considering dual causality).
