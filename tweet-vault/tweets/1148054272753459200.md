@MariaGlymour @yudapearl @PHuenermund @EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer @autoregress How could it if you don’t even understand why the variable varies? If you disagree, provide a single example – even a made-up example – where you think contextual knowledge would suffice to close off back door paths without knowing why X varies.
