@TuckerGoodrich @DaveKeto @DrNadolsky "The researchers created groups of people by “cutting” the predictor variable, meat, into four groups, those eating approximately 76, 125, 171, and 251 grams of meat per day. These groups had 322, 309, 304 and 290 deaths respectively."

But after adjustments meat kills. 😤
