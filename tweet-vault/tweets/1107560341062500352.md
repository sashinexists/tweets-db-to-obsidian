@yudapearl @Jabaluck @CarterPaddy Most economists know something about prime and complex numbers, but we mostly don't use them. Our problems are in real numbers, so it would be irresponsible to suggest that we don't understand complex numbers because we don't use them more often. They are just not the best tool.
