Econonists are trained to find flaws in models, however
plausible, so much so that they have lost the capacity to ask: "Suppose the model was correct, what do I do with it?" As a result, they lost the skill to repair the flaws they labor to discover -- others (epi?) are doing it. https://t.co/x8yuui4yfA
