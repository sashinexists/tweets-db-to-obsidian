Congratulations to Scott and his graduating class -- the FIRST ever high-school to master causal inference! These kids are heading to college and I don't envy their stat-101 professors; they would not let them get away with  causality-blind cliches. They will demand substance. https://t.co/cqeyuUQwlB
