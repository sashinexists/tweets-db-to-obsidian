@stephensenn @f2harrell @sadneurons @DrewLevy I am still trying to understand what makes "cherry-picked correlations" less reliable than "reliable measures of association". To define 
"reliable" we need to agree on the research question and see which of the two gives us a better answer to the question asked. Puzzled.
