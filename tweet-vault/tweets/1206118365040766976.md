@RonKenett @AndreaSaltelli I am celebrating a new ability: To take 10 meaningful examples and solve them formally from A to Z, and you are inviting me to go back to the hand-waving days of "gaining understanding" w/o solving any of those examples.What is gained by reminding people of those days? #Bookofwhy
