@irinarish @yudapearl If seeing the world as "it really is" = "in an unbiased way", then consider that learning is impossible in those conditions. See: https://t.co/6cIJZ5gYoQ. In fact, uniform priors represent a relatively strong form of bias. They lead you to take bets even when you know nothing.
