@robertwplatt @Jabaluck @maximananyev @PHuenermund Such a "Hey Look" alert invariably evokes the question: "What will we be missing if we ignore the Hey Look?" And then the answer: "You wont be able to do X Y Z" creates professional indignation: We can't do X Y Z? Conclusion, do X Y Z before going back to Apple Pie. #Bookofwhy.
