@PHuenermund @yudapearl @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal I don't think there is such a thing as the "ground truth" in this context. In any context there are an enormous number of variables that could conceivably be included in a DAG, and which DAG you write will depend on whether you start with a tDAG or not. You said you disagreed.
