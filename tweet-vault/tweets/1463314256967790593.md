@artistexyz , glad you decided to include Selection Bias (SB) in your book. SB is a funny topic. Statisticians believe they own it because of Abraham Wald. Economists, because of Heckman Selection. But none formulated the problem in its generality, not to mention solving it (1/2) https://t.co/nhVuvgmTDB
