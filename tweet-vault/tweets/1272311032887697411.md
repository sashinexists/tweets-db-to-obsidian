@kareem_carr @jodiecongirl I would forgive the irony if it was only in usage of words, not usage of tools. But I think you are right that stat folks emphasize analysis of variance more than ML folks. Both are stuck, of course, at Rung-1, borrowing terminology from higher rungs, eg "explain" "attribute".
