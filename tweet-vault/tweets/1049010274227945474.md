@JohannesTextor @MariaGlymour @mendel_random @statsepi @yudapearl 3/ I feel the discussion is upside down â€” the larger point is that knowledge needs to be articulated first (i.e., causal model), and then one can see how the distribution of interest can be identified, perhaps by the backdoor, frontdoor, napkin, IV, or any other strategy.
