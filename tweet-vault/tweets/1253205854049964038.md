@analisereal @Jabaluck @yudapearl @gelbach @HeerJeet Fwiw, I tend to think the independence and exclusion restrictions we make, in PO notation, are pretty transparent (though certainly not free from debate!)

I 100% agree you might want to model deviations from these assumptions. We only disagree that DAGs are the only or best way
