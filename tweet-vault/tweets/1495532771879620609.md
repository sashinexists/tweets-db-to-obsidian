@ylecun @TMoldwin @yudapearl Physicists have a very clear notion of causality, thank you, and it's not at all related to the time symmetry or otherwise of the basic laws of dynamics.
The physics idea of causality: if you have two events in spacetime, there can at most be a one-way signal between the two.
