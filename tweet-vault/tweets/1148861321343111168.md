@yudapearl @autoregress @PHuenermund @pablogerbas @juli_schuess @fuzzydunlop123 @MariaGlymour @EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer @metrics52 @eliasbareinboim more generally I think econs are often sloppy about what controls to include in their models and would benefit from thinking about these issues in a more formal way. What do you think you could learn from econs about how to do causal inference better?
