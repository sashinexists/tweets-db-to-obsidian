@stephensenn @RonKenett @learnfromerror This is precisely what we, causal inference students, are trying to learn from you. I, for one, do not understand the vocabulary of "design", "block" "within subject studies" "inherently predictive" etc. But once we learn your intuition, we will automate it, promise. #Bookofwhy
