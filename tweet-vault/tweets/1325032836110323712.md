Good question. Note however that (absent temporal information) any data fitted by y=f(x,eps) can be equally fitted by x=g(y,eps') . From the graph we see that neither model imposes any conditional probability constraint. It's also clear in linear models: https://t.co/xXl4OMhduq https://t.co/aNOgaOIZDt
