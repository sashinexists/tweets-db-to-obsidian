@a40ruhr @USF_Economics @causalinf @mustafahzahid I fail to detect cyclicity. Can you  point to it? I think the structure is ideal to serve as a homework in modern econ. textbooks, asking students to identify the causal effect using IV method. This should lure "experimental economists" to catch up with modernity. #Bookofwhy
