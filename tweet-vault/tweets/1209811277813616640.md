@yudapearl @hardmaru @ngutten @jsusskin @LeCun @thomaskipf I think what we see a lot lately in #DeepLearning is that known concepts and algorithms are integrated into deep networks. Quite a few energy minimization methods can be mapped and made trainable. The question is whether algorithms for CI can be formulated in this way.
