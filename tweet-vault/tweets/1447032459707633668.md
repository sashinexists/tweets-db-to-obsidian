This, IMO, is a very good paper, which you deem "a false model of causation". Instead, you propose: "an open-ended mechanisms: learning, rules, selection." I'd consider switching, if you tell me what kind of questions your "open-ended" alternative would answer: Input=? Output=? https://t.co/R0xwbOpd7e
