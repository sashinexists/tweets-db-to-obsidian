@Jabaluck @eliasbareinboim @autoregress @yudapearl @CarterPaddy twitter is notorious at this. we can't sufficiently explain what we want to say and the reader is left to fill in the gaps. this filling of gaps is often wrong. so, as elias said, we need to slow it down and take smaller bites. to start, define "good causal empirical work."
