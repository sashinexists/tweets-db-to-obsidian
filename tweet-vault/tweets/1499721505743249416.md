@yudapearl @soboleffspaces You want to talk about this with a “formal notation” - I’m obviously not smart enough for that, so words will do. I’ll find it easier to discuss this issue of how the “O” group differs from A &amp; B if we can use an actual example of a trial that would happen in the real world.
