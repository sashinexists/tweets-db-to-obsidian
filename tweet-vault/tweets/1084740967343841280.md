@mendel_random @yudapearl @StatModeling The word "data-derived" is misleading (at best). "Data-derived" is very different from model-implied. Our IV algorithms are purely based on the DAG structure and do not use data at all. You make it sound like the investigator simply provides a dataset and then dagitty finds IVs.
