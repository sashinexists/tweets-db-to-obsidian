@yudapearl @fuzzydunlop123 @autoregress @MariaGlymour @PHuenermund @EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer @metrics52 Again, it is absolutely comical to applied economists when you assert that we don't bother justifying the exclusion restriction when large fractions of our seminars and papers are devoted to doing just that. Could those arguments also be represented with a DAG? Sure.
