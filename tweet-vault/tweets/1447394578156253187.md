@desertcran @tadesouaiaia @johndawkins @athie_gnome @gibletsMoon @rasmansa I do not know a single statistician who remains in disagreement with me, once we sit down and explicate the disagreements. That is why I beg my angry critiques to be specific, can we? Your comment on correlation and causation, for example, is specific, but in error.
