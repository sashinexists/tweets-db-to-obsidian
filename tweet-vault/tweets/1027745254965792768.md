@EpiEllie @malco_barrett @NeuroStats @l__ds @ken_rothman This is not to say that PIEs have no role in SCM. But as analysts we need to explicate this role carefully if we want robots to use PIEs, or even just to teach Epi students, and "help them think". What can they do with a PIE at hand, compared with PIE in the sky? #Bookofwhy  n/n
