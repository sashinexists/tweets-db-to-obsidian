We must stick to the rules. We do not talk about "your DAG"; only  about "Miguel-authored DAG". If Miguel ever includes a variable "gender" or "blood pressure" in a DAG, then the causal effect of that variable is quantified and interpreted with no trepidation. #causalinference https://t.co/Jl08ov0QI1
