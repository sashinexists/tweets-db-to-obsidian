@AndrewPGrieve @jd_wilko Thanks @AndrewPGrieve, but I think @stephensenn does not object to seeing such large a difference between men and female. The surprising element is that we can detect this difference ONLY by conducting observational study -- it does not show in the RCT. @f2harrell @soboleffspaces
