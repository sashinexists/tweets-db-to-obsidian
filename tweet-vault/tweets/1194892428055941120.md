These are the best lectures (and course notes) I have seen in statistical education. Not so much because they are DAGy, but b/c they are given by a "data scientist", as opposed to a "data analyst." We need a new discipline: "scientific statistics" to replace "statistical science" https://t.co/P04qVH8VKC
