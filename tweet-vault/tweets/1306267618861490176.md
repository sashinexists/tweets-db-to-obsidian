@m_clem @PHuenermund @julianschuess @nickchk @yudapearl Just to clarify, if we want the ATE of 6th grade (X), we still do need to adjust for 5th grade (Z)---but this adjustment involves both computing the effect of X within strata of Z, and averaging over Z. This gives the correct ATE, and does not alter the estimand.
