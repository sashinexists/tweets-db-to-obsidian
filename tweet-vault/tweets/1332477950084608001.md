@yudapearl @causalinf @steventberry @lewbel @PHuenermund @econbookclub @analisereal @jdramirezc @PhilHaile Thanks. My copy of Causality is at the office so might as well be on the moon, but by cycles do you mean a model like Leroy's?

P = f( Q )
Q = g( P )

If so, in contrast to the impression one gets from econometrics texts, that isn't the causal structure of supply &amp; demand.
