@analisereal @eliasbareinboim @autoregress @yudapearl @PACESconsulting @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @HeerJeet Yes, I don't think backdoor is generally better than front-door. Our objections to front-door designs apply equally well to trying to close off all confounding paths with no further design. I like designs that circumscribe the set of confounding paths from the start.
