@omaclaren @yudapearl @PHuenermund I am somewhat familiar w/ hierarchical models and bayes nets, so your reply is puzzling. Double checking since I may have misunderstood u...  Are u claiming HMs do identification of causal effects..? HM is a type of regression where the goal is to min variance, layer1-type task.
