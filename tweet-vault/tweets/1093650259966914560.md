@EpiEllie @yudapearl @eddericu @iwashyna @Amy_Bohnert @Research_ICU @NEJM @_MiguelHernan I am also curious. What is a "target trial"? Is it different than the usual clinical trials (call "non-target")? I guess the difference cannot be only that one can "estimate the conditional or marginal average effects" since these can be estimated from non-target trials as well.
