@PHuenermund @yudapearl For rain, we could imagine an intervention such as seeding the clouds. But, would rain produced that way have the same effect on our outcome as natural rain? Does the quantity, duration, timing of rain matter? These contribute to definition of intervention &amp; of causal effect.
