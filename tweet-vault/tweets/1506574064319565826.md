@soboleffspaces @JohanDH2O I have naively assumed that all arrows are causal (as defined above). But you are telling us: No need, trialists hate causation, they love conditional independencies. Lets
use the graph to convey independencies, not causal arrows. I say: OK, just tell me which independencies.
