@mstephens999 @y2silence I haven't thought about what Pr(Y(u)=y | do(X(u)=x)) could mean. But now that I think about it, the answer would be either 1 or 0. Because the Y(u) takes some value, say y' , which is either equal to y or not. If u is picked up at random we get P(Y=y|do(X=x)) w/o u. #Bookofwhy
