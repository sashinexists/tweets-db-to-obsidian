@yudapearl @noah_greifer @soboleffspaces @causalinf @EpiEllie @Lizstuartdc I think we generally agree here. My argument was that ignorability alone is not enough for the CATE to equal the ITE and to show that with simple examples. Other methods might be used to bound it or identify it with repeated obs on the individual (with additional assumptions)
