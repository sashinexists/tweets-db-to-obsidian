@eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @Jabaluck @CarterPaddy Yes I'm familiar with both problems -- they're neat! But I think this is not about toy problems. I'm sure there are also neat arithmetic problems that can (per Jason) be solved either in base 8 or 10, though some may find the latter easier. But are these ever found "in the wild"?
