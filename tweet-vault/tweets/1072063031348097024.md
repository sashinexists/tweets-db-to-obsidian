@Physical_Prep @_MiguelHernan @ChristophMolnar Whose article did you love? No, I have not read yet the book by Molnar but, from his description, it seems that he takes interpretability to be machine's ability to show that it did what it was told, not why it was necessary to do. The latter requires a causal model. #Bookofwhy
