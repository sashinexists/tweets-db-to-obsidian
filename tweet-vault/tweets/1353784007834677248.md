@yudapearl @kareem_carr Just want to point out here that, on the most popular, Russellian, interpretation of "Kareem has not read Pearl's book" this claim is false in virtue of "there is a unique thing such that it is Pearl's book" being false. (This is just my dysfunctional way of asking--which book??)
