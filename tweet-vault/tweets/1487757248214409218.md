@gottfriedmath @soboleffspaces @causalinf @nickchk @EpiEllie @profnfenton If you express formally the counterfactual question asked (about Fred's would be life expectancy) you will see that it differs from what is computed using CBN. This means that there are more than one SCM that satisfy the initial CBN probabilities, giving different PN values.
