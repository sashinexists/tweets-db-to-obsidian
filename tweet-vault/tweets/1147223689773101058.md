@Jabaluck @EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer @MariaGlymour @autoregress I thought about this point still quite a bit after our last discussion. It's actually a strange notion for me to require understanding all the variation in a random variable. Econometrics always worked with random unexplained background factors that create variance in a variable.
