@fields_unsown @DrNo_MoMoney @SlezakPeter @btselem @hrw Tel Aviv was established in 1909, way before any settlement. So, Palestinians must decide on Tel Aviv first. If they still take it as stolen, then we are in a state of WAR and land ownership in times of war is not a simple issue, some lands must be controlled to secure lives.
