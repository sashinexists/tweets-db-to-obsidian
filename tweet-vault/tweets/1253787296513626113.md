@maximananyev @Jabaluck @yudapearl I actually think of DAGs as a helpful way to formalize which arrows that must be missing for an id strategy to work. 

PO statements point to equivalence classes of structural models. The DAGs corresponding to those structural models are typically unified by missing arrows.
