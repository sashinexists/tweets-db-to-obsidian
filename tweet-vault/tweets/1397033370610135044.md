Reverse Orientalism.
Edward Said would hit the roof if a Westerner dared define what a "Palestinian" is. @4noura has no qualms defining what Jewishness is. Tragically, Palestinians haven't realized that the majority of Jews are secular - a people bonded by history, not religion. https://t.co/6q1lYdriyM
