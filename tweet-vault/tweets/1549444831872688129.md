@jonathanrichens @yudapearl @tom4everitt @nickinpractice @davidad @eliasbareinboim @victorveitch @RichardMCNgo @SmithaMilli @ryancareyai @gusl Interesting definition, thanks. But it has the same fundamental flaw as any counterfactual view on observational data... it depends on your model that you have to define it (M in this definition). And this is very dangerous since your model is most likely to be wrong in medicine. https://t.co/cjzNuL5zJS
