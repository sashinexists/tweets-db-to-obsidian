@yudapearl @pietrobiroli @PHuenermund @instrumenthull @paulgp @dlmillimet @eliasbareinboim I would love to hear you describe how a natural direct effect for any variable of your choosing could ever be estimated in any time of actual experimental study. I don’t believe we can, which is why I say there’s no real world analog. Can you?
