@EpiEllie @pietrobiroli @PHuenermund @instrumenthull @paulgp @dlmillimet @eliasbareinboim As one who coined the term "Natural," please allow me to define it the way it was defined in 2001 https://t.co/qmum2t6MQg, Definition  4. Adding, of course, the phrase: "for that specific individual", since we are dealing with a "unit level" definition.
