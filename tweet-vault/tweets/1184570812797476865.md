I’ve long been writing antisemitism but David also makes a strong case for writing antizionism. It makes sense to me.Added bonus:it saves a few characters on Twitter—1 for the hyphen &amp; 2 for “” that I often put around anti-Zionism to express the same idea. Antizionism it is then. https://t.co/azxQuJ7Jaa
