@omaclaren @statwonk @yudapearl @PHuenermund To avoid getting lost in Twitter, we did NOT simulate the data but we sampled from the real world &amp; got points from P(S, T, C). In turn, this allowed us to recover the hat P(S, T, C), without knowing f_S, f_T, f_C &amp; P(G). The task is to compute P(C | do(T)) using HM. How?
