@maximananyev @robertwplatt @yudapearl @PHuenermund better on average. What I would say is, if a paper uses a quasi-experiment, the best such papers are more credible on average than the best observational studies (although even the best papers are far from bullet-proof, even from an internal validity standpoint).
