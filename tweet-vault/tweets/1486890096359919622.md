Rev. Nelson should resign. It was indeed with friends from the Wiesenthal Center that we went to Alabama to speak at the Presbyterian conference about peace in the ME. This was before this warm community got hijacked by incurable Zionophobes like Rev. Nelson. He should resign!!! https://t.co/k15iCoSdt2
