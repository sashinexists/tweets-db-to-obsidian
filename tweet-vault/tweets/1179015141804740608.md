@amitabhchandra2 @AdanZBecerra1 A DAG is a carrier of knowledge, hence I find it indispensable in thinking about MTE, or other properties of populations.Not alone, of course, but in combination with counterfactual logic. It is easier to educate those who misuse DAGs than those who misuse other texts #Bookofwhy
