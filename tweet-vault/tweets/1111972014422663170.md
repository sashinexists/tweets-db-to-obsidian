@yudapearl @ho_ben @causalinf @Susan_Athey And it bears repeating, I think economists should learn DAGs and use them much more regularly. My only point above is that DAGs don't subsume all existing work in ID. Sometimes "parametric"ID results (in the @yudapearl sense) rely on weaker assumptions than nonparametric ones.
