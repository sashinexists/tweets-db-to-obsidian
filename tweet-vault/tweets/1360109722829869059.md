What we saw at @ASUCI last night is partly a result of our fixation on anti-Semitism as a litmus test of moral deformity.
Who cares if BDS is or isn't anti-Semitic. The question should be is BDS aiming at dismantling a homeland of a nation. Are they or aren't they Zionophobic? https://t.co/jvsFK0K65v
