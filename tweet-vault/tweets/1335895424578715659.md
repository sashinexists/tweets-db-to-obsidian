I need to second this tweet, b/c it is becoming increasingly important. Call it "causal inference" (CI) if it uses some causal model of the world. Else, call it by the name of whatever it models. For example, RCT is not CI because it is model-blind, though it estimates effects. https://t.co/RVRZ51zsYS
