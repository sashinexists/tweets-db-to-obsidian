@PavlosMsaouel @yudapearl @ESteyerberg @LinkedIn @Lester_Domes @MariaGlymour @NP_Jewell @XiaoLiMeng1 Yes but it goes further than that. When one says "adjust for X to judge the effect of Z on Y" there can be more than one way to adjust for X if one has a hierarchical dataset. I am concerned that one should choose the right one.
