@yudapearl @pietrobiroli @PHuenermund @instrumenthull @paulgp @dlmillimet @eliasbareinboim That implies that there are no time-varying causes of the mediator other than the exposure, which is fine—if thats a required assumption, I can see how the whole thing works out when that’s true. But I have never seen that assumption stated, in your or anyone else’s work on this.
