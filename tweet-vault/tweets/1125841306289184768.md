@juli_schuess @yudapearl @sweichwald Yes! In ch. 7.4.2 of Causality, @yudapearl proves that Lewis's closest worlds formalism is identical to the formalism of structural causal models for recursive systems.  With make-cg, parallel worlds are formally reduced to counterfactual graphs, so the analogy is actually exact!
