@Jabaluck @causalinf @PHuenermund @lewbel @Susan_Athey @pedrohcgs @snavarrol @TymonSloczynski @tdetonberry @MacroPru W&amp;L tell you which X to prefer, staying within OLS.  BTW, I've never met anyone more agnostic about structure than about the assumption {Y_1, Y_0 || D | X} with which so many "real life" econ problems start and end. Nor have I seen a "fully specified structure" used for anything.
