@stephensenn @mendel_random @_MiguelHernan @statsepi I am trying to understand where the multidimensionality of correlation comes from, but can't find a compelling example, void of links to other papers. Can you help? If it is an intrinsic feature of correlation than it be conveyed w/o reference to methods of estimating correlation
