If Jewish leadership failed us on Jewish Heritage Month, @newzionists should fill the gap, since Israel is the culmination of Jewish heritage. How about extending it by one week, till June 7, and make up for this sloppiness by celebrating seven pillars of Heritage, one each day. https://t.co/vW1ULfnxMa
