@noah_greifer @soboleffspaces @causalinf @EpiEllie @bveg3 If you base your belief on the cited paper by @bveg3, I would soften it a bit. The paper speaks potential outcomes, but does not invoke the First Law, https://t.co/etASSEk4Or, nor its implications on probabilities of causation, cited here: https://t.co/rGHIc9kH0O, @Lizstuartdc
