@drenerbas @rravi @ylecun @TMoldwin I refrain from discussing entropy, especially in information theory, because it is a probabilistic notion, which I am trying to separate from causal notions. I mentioned it once in #Bookofwhy, as an example of irreversible emergent property that holds in the macro world only.
