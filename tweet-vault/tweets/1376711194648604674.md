These suggestions of fighting off the theatrics of "Israel Apartheid Week" are fine, but they lack one weapon: HUMOR. Imagine the comedy that Charlie Chaplin ("The Great  Dictator") would have created out of the Palestinian Apartheid Factory. Enlist Woody Alan and Mel Brooks. https://t.co/E3RjU8SNPJ
