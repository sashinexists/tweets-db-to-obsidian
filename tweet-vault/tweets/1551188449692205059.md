@yudapearl @ToKTeacher @DavidDeutschOxf There is a type of “intervention” on a [fallibly] presumed invariant causal process [“a”], namely manipulation/alteration of process a itself, using new explanatory knowledge so as to create a newly “invariant” causal process “b”. Probability has nothing to say about that!
