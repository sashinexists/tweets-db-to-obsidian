@robertwplatt @EpiEllie @zshahn @_MiguelHernan What's the puzzle? "What if I take aspirin" is hypothetical intervention". "What if I had not taken aspirin" is hypothetical counterfactual. The authors of English blessed us with useful grammatical distinction and we, scientists, can't fit it into Rung-2 vs. 3. Odd !!#Bookofwhy
