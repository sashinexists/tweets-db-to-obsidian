@yudapearl @FJnyc @DavidHirsh @KeithKahnHarris I don’t agree. “Phobia” is often an unhelpful suffix that obscures more than it clarifies. And I also want to preserve space for a critique that acknowledges Zionism has become core to Jewish identity for understandable historical reasons, but is also critical of Zionism.
