@VC31415 @sbuhai @yudapearl @JaapAbbring @Chris_Auld @DonskerClass @lewbel @steventberry You keep conflating description and interpretation. I can report a sample mean and std deviation without any assumption.  Interpreting as related to the population requires some assumptions on the underlying structure.
