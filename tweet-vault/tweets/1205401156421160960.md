The pleasure was mutual and I was thrilled by the "philosophical twist" of today's talk. First time I speak about Bayes' pool table (p. 98 #Bookofwhy) realizing that most people (including Bayesians) dont really know what Bayes did and what the controversy is all about. New book? https://t.co/JTy2WQCdeW
