@yudapearl @KordingLab @Jabaluck @maximananyev @PHuenermund What defines “a field”? What constitutes the body of literature for a field? And how could one evaluate the entire literature? The assumption is hard to understand. And if it were true, how would you know whether it was due to malevolent mysterious forces rather than ignorance?
