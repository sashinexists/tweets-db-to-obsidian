@dlmillimet @pedrohcgs @snavarrol @TymonSloczynski I have tried to learn from your sausage, but could not tell if you meant "how econ. sausage IS made" vs. "how econ. sausage SHOULD BE made". I am eager to see the "IS" and "SHOULD" applied to the toy example cited here: https://t.co/zik6ri5Nvi, so we can see every step.
