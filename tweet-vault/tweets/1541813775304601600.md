@StaceyEBurke @Vandalay_Inc @ShMMor @AIPAC This may be the reason why JStreet, as well as @NewIsraelFund , spend their time attacking other Jewish organizations - impressing their donors with some action and uniqueness. I once wrote an oped about the Jews of Discomfort: https://t.co/lz8kD9bPxU
Still relevant today.
