Conceptually I like distinction btw "front door" and "back door" identification in "The Book of Why." (See slides from my lectures.) But I know I am not alone among economists in struggling to think of an econ app. for front door. Any suggestions out there? @yudapearl @Jabaluck https://t.co/6PN6bIgdWq
