Level 2 probabilities contain either Y_0 or Y_1, not both, nor anything contradicting the antecedent or the outcome. Consider ETT=P(Y_0=1| X=1) =P(y_x'|x) and recall how it is treated (for binary X) in Causality p. 396-7 https://t.co/LBg4fa2oHN
P(Y_0=1|Y=0) is, likewise, Level 3. https://t.co/hsutvZTHEo
