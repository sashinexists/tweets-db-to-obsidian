@analisereal @yudapearl @PACESconsulting @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @Jabaluck @HeerJeet @eliasbareinboim At the risk of being provocative and saying something more extreme than I think, the difference seems between proposing a new method/model for a problem and proposing a way to check whether a given model of a problem has a solution

Both are very important. But they're different
