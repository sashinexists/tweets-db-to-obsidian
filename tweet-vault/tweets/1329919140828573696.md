@deaneckles @eliasbareinboim @PHuenermund @AndersHuitfeldt No reason for frustration. Anyone with new ideas and promising directions can formalize them and launch an effort to "solve" them. This does not absolve the new formalizer from knowing the extent to which the earlier formulation of the problem was "solved".
