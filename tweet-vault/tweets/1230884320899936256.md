@dopamine_uptake @pierre_rochard @WhiteRabbitBTC @TheStalwart @100trillionUSD to make this more clear - using the predictor (0.4*s2f^3), the model itself stipulates a rapid appreciation (i.e. within a week). smoothing it on a discretionary basis to expand the window is fine, but that's not what the model as constructed says. https://t.co/h3VGgWulvD
