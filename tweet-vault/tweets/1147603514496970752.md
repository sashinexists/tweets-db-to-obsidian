@danilobzdok @f2harrell Neural network is a man-made artifact, crafted to capture some aspects of the data, say the relationship between symptoms &amp; disease. By a "model" we mean a picture of reality, from which the data emerged. e.g. X---&gt;Y and X&lt;---Y are two different models that may yield same NN.
