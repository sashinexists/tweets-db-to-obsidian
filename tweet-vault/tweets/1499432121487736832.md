@stephensenn @yudapearl @f2harrell @soboleffspaces @SMuellerLab It *would* be possible to meet this condition if you maintained the same exact workflow as the RCT – people present, we ask if they’re willing to be in the study, and they are randomly assigned to drug A, drug B, or C (their choice of A or B).
