@EpiEllie @malco_barrett @NeuroStats @l__ds @ken_rothman Continuing with interactions. Note that I wrote a do-expression P(Y|do(x),do(z)) and NOT a conditional expression as habits and PIEs so seductively tempt us to do. Note also that  PIEs tacitly insist on components being Parents(Y), not so X and Z  above. #Bookofwhy 3/n
