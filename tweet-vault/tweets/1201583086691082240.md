This is very interesting. The abstract isn't super clear but basically: find a subsample for whom the treatment effect is theoretically 0, then estimate the effect for them - that's all bias, so now you know the bias and can adjust. Paper's very readable. https://t.co/yt8tFKFk1l https://t.co/DI6Y1CwDnU
