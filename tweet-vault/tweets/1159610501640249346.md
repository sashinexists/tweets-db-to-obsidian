@causalinf @steventberry @paulgp @lewbel @causalinf, Are you really going to replace "identification" with "design"???. Clarity with escapism?? "Identification" is perhaps the clearest notion developed by economists --"Design" is the foggiest .  @Undercoverhist, as historian, watch the last days of clarity.#Bookofwhy
