On personal note, is because of #DannyPearl I am in #Israel. At time of his execution (2002), I was finishing university in Australia. His final profound words caused me to reflect on my own Jewish identity &amp; centrality of Israel, leading on path where I am today. cc. @yudapearl https://t.co/Lw0WaL2gRM
