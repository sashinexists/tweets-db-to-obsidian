@suchisaria @KordingLab @fhuszar @tdietterich @zittrain @eliasbareinboim The idea of "surgery estimators" is ingenious, it would not occur to me that you can get extra mileage on top of "pruned estimators". However, is Figure 2(b) the simplest example to show this extra mileage?? Would c-equivalence help here? https://t.co/f2oN7JDWMF #Bookofwhy
