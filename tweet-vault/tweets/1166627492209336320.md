@DanzigMD @emc2G @Ilhan @RashidaTlaib @PeterBeinart I, for one, never understood what people are trying to achieve by saying the conflict is "COMPLICATED". An excuse from solving it? A diversion from addressing its core? To me, it's baby simple: A clash between two legitimate national movements, one says WE, the other says ME.
