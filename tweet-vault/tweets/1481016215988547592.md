while you read this book, highly recommend, print out the ladder of causation on page 28 &amp; read the chapter,  (seeing/association -&gt; doing/intervention -&gt; imagining/counterfactuals) really well before u move to the nextâ€¦it will be referred thru-out the book &amp; central to the book https://t.co/7wTodmlJlj
