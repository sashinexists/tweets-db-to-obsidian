@steventberry @MariaGlymour @Jabaluck @IvanWerning @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @autoregress We shouldn't argue about ancient history. I am trying to inform my students and other DAG-minded researchers how to communicate with economists, i.e., when an economist tells you "This is a reduced form equation" what does he/she mean? What does the equation claim etc.#Bookofwhy
