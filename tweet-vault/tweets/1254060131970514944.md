@Liv_Boeree @robertwiblin Collider bias? I.e. let X be 🚬 and Y be how serious your case of 🦠 would otherwise be. X and Y contribute to you getting symptoms from 🦠, but Y contributes much more to your ☠️ or survival. So it looks like 🚬 helps recovery but really 🚬=proxy 4 less serious cause of symptoms
