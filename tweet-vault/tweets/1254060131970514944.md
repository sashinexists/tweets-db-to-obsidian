@Liv_Boeree @robertwiblin Collider bias? I.e. let X be üö¨ and Y be how serious your case of ü¶† would otherwise be. X and Y contribute to you getting symptoms from ü¶†, but Y contributes much more to your ‚ò†Ô∏è or survival. So it looks like üö¨ helps recovery but really üö¨=proxy 4 less serious cause of symptoms
