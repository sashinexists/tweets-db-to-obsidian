Agree. With two points of caution:(1) We need to study carefully the theoretical impediments to automated generation, to avoid falling for fake-gold, and (2) We need to study carefully what we can and cannot do with a causal model once we have it. The rest is just math #Bookofwhy https://t.co/ubTAR58jAy
