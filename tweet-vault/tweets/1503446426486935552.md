@paulgp @instrumenthull @soboleffspaces @jmwooldridge @causalinf @Nichogachet @pedrohcgs @lewbel @BruceEHansen If you define "potential outcome" in  counterfactual language, ie "had X been 0", you
are OK. But if you define it in "treatment-assignment" language (as Rubin did) there is a gap to fill, since many SEM models do not have "treatment" defined.
