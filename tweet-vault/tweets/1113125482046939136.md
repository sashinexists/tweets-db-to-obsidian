@autoregress @eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @Jabaluck @CarterPaddy Are you assuming z(x) \indep y(x)? This does not hold in the simple front-door graph. z(x) is a function of everything that affects z, except for x. y(x) is a function of everything that affects y, except for x. Since Z may affect Y, these two vars are dependent.
