@yudapearl @jrootham @MelissaLantsman It means that they would like to see Palestinians freed from illegal military occupation and apartheid. No ethnic group is more important than any other ethnic group. All ethnicities deserve freedom. Equating Palestinian freedom with Jewish oppression is racist.
