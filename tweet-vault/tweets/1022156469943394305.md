@analisereal @yudapearl @aynumazi @Harvard You seem to argue that the do-operator encompasses 2 different operators: Robins's 1986 #gformula and Pearl's front-door. Fair enough.

So you must disagree with Judea's statement that causal inference "did not become operational" until 1993.

Next time please identify yourself.
