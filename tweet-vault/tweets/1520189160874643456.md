@AsraNomani @JasonMiyaresVA @jilvorg @JewishJournal @Think_Schultz @LarryOConnor @garrytan I don't mind being called anti-Semite, as long as they don't call me anti-Zionist -- the ugliest label in today's market.
But why do you call those people "Democrats"?
People who call Asians "white adjacent" are just racist, not Democrats.
