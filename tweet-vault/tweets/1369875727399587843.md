I especially love Rubin's: “[Graphs are] based on an
unprincipled and confused theoretical perspective.” and “to avoid conditioning on some observed
covariates,... is nonscientific ad hockery.” His disciples continue in his track, e.g. Imben's "Comparison" https://t.co/sZPpL7Ifmg https://t.co/H5z0FAckNs
