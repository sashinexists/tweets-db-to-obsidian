@WC_Lab @johnsontoddr4 @aruncann @bugwonk @_MiguelHernan The do-operator is a mathematical operation on a model. Of course it does not "exist" as intervention in the physical world. But it can be given an interpretation as if Nature performs a minimal surgery. If you are bothered by the poetry, replace "do-operator" by "Operation-23".
