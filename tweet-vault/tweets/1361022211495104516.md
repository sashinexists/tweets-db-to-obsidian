@charleskfisher @NikosNi41644559 Let me put it this way. If your task is to tell cats from dogs you wouldn't use one "inductive bias" for cats and one for dogs -- that would be cheating. Similarly, if our task is to decide if the effect of X on Y is positive or negative, we must use the same inductive bias.
