@soboleffspaces @yudapearl @smueller @stephensenn @RWJE_BA @PavlosMsaouel @f2harrell @ChristosArgyrop @AndrewPGrieve @HL327 The only assumption is that z is not affected by X, otherwise, p(y_x|z) is counterfactual rather than causal effects. But when we are using RCT data to obtain the z-PNS bounds, we might need the assumption that the RCT data represent the true distribution of P(y_x|z).
