@AdanZBecerra1 @yudapearl @PHuenermund @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal Your question is not about the causal impact of race on outcomes, it's about what happens if we vary treatment for people of different races. From that perspective, income and the other factors I mentioned are confounds.
