@Chris_Auld @autoregress @steventberry @MariaGlymour @Jabaluck @IvanWerning @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas Sorry, I thought you said that (quoting): "equation 3.46 in Causality is a ratio of two reduced forms", so I looked at 3.46 and found there a ratio of two cond. expectations. I will try to be less pedantic. (Unless you would you like me to be more pedantic?) #Bookofwhy
