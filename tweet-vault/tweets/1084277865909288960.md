@omaclaren @yudapearl @PHuenermund If u assume the causal relations away (e.g., have the real structural equations), all that remains is estimation. Sure, you can use HMs, Deep Nets, or whatever you want to estimate the params, which will be "causal". But there's no real manipulation of causality, just estimation.
