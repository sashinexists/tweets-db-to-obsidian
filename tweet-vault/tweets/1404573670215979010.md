@yudapearl @SpeakerPelosi You have a ruthlessly logical mind, Mr. Pearl. I know you do. So I cannot fathom why you abandon it here. 

Pelosi has an 8 person majority. That means the liberal caucus can block passage of bills if they want to. Would you rather she win rhetorical fights or legislative ones?
