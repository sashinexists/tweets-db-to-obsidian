@yudapearl @stephensenn @statsepi #bookofwhy doesn't consider the possible effect of hall on weight change beyond diet (perhaps its a 3 mile hike up a hill to get to hall B).  But that's clearly not the point, its a lovely explanation of Lord's paradox, just not the basis for any actual study design or analysis.
