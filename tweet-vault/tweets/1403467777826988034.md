@RabbiWolpe @nytimes @CNN @NewsHour @yudapearl @SethAMandel @DrMichaelOren @bariweiss More dispiriting: After Linda Sarsour embraced &amp; supported Rasmea Odeh, &gt; 100 progressive U.S. Jewish leaders wrote letter denouncing those who "falsely maligned, harassed and smeared" Sarsour.  While properly condemned physical threats, letter said criticism lacked "compassion."
