@Jabaluck @yudapearl @causalinf @steventberry @paulgp @lewbel @Undercoverhist I guess, if you are only interested on the effect on people who acquired four additional years of schooling just because they won the lottery, then yes. 

But if you are interested more generally in the effect of schooling on wages you need a structural model.
