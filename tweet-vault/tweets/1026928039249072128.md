@yudapearl @NeuroStats @l__ds @ken_rothman @EpiEllie Absolutely! In fact, for me, that's a much more interesting question because it implies something about how it can be visualized. For 1) maybe the example from Modern Epidemiology is better because it's more explicit. The pies are deterministic in that sense. 1/3 https://t.co/YfbyYjnK4K
