There is another point which perhaps has not been acknowledged in @chipro ML account of "data shifts". You can't see the difference between "data shifts" and "model shifts" if all you have is data. It is only when you formulate a model (eg, DAG) that you can see its importance. https://t.co/8bj0E16e94
