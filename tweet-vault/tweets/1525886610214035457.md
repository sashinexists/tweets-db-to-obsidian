@ZachLewis3187 @LahavHarkov @yudapearl Another comparison is that land was taken from India under the auspices of the UN and Pakistan was created. No one questions Pakistan’s right to exist. At the same time the UN segmented land for Israel and since 1948 there has been nothing but denial of Israel’s right to exist.
