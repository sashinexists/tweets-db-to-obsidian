@akelleh @eliasbareinboim @deaneckles One more thing to notice; we did not call it "post stratification". Who invented this terminology? Note we never ask: "Is post-stratification helpful?". Instead, we ask: Is there a way of recovering from selection bias, be it post-stratification, crazy-stratification or whatever?
