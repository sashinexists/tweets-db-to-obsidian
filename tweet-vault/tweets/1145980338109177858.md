1/2 Nice and concise summary of #Bookofwhy. If I were forced to make a critical comment, it would be the way it tries to stimulates readers interest by pointing to existing interest. What if no ML conference had any session on causation, would that make the ideas of #Bookofwhy https://t.co/tb6A3VfIbj
