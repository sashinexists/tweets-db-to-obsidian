@DavidHarrisAJC , I never pass through Rome without a visit to Arco di Tito https://t.co/zeNOWgoPwl
the unassailable proof of a sovereign Jewish homeland 1951 years ago, ironically erected to mark the end of that sovereignty. An AJC video on Arco di Tito would be timely in 2021. https://t.co/LAlATFhLDS
