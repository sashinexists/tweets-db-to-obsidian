@DrBobGoldberg @AishaAriella Much worse. The wicked child in the Haggadah says: Hey, what is this that you are doing? @AishaArielle says: I despise, not only what you are doing, but who you are, where you came from, your fears and hopes, and I'm committed to smearing your character wherever I go. Much worse!
