It's not only @SpeakerPelosi and @ilhan Omar. The banalization of evil thrives best when  a public institution provides a platform for bigots like Patrisse Cullorse or Linda Sarsour to spew their hate in the name of some noble cause, and decent people say: No point fighting it. https://t.co/RX13bdiW6z
