1/ In re-reading Holland (1986) I noted that he was the first to define CI as a missing data problem, through his "Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference", which so many PO folks love to quote. Today, in contrast, we are classifying "missing data" as a causal inference problem https://t.co/dMxnfZ7ewh
