@yudapearl @EinatWilf @HananyaNaftali Because Antizionism is pretty much a consensus among the political left?

It doesn't matter anyway. Someone who can run for the highest office in a state even though he had been paid to work for an enemy propaganda channel 'could shoot somebody and wouldn't lose any voters'.
