@yudapearl @Ya3il8200 @blakeflayton Systemic inequity isn’t a populist slogan — it’s an accurate description of the disparity between the quality of life of Israeli Jews and Palestinians. It’s no secret that Israel has been victimized by its neighbors but that doesn’t justify occupation and oppression.
