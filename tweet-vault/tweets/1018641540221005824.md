@f2harrell @eliasbareinboim Simulation surely helps, thanks. But one of your operations was "draw theta from a distribution" and, if I remember correctly, "distribution" is an asymptotic entity. Moreover, assume your simulation is successful, what general lesson can we conclude from the success? #bookofwhy
