@PHuenermund @julianschuess @analisereal @nickchk @yudapearl I just point out that for many practitioners, your graph implies that '5th grade' is a 'good control' in general. It is something that affects both the outcome directly and a variable of interest, so it must be 'controlled for'. But doing so inherently alters the estimand.
