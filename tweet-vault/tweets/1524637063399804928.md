@TacoCohen @eliasbareinboim @saramagliacane @yudapearl @JorisMooij @bschoelkopf @carlorovelli @seanmcarroll @rosemary_ke If we can perform interventions in the real platform, we could e.g. turn on the lights in a way that wasn’t seen before and look at correspondences in the repr or better predict the light variable if we change the switch in a novel way all from the repr (no need to reconstruct)
