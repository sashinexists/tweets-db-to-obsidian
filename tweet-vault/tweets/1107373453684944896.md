@autoregress @yudapearl @Jabaluck @CarterPaddy Regarding the frontdoor or napkin, these are just toy examples where the current language has a hard time solving, I personally never saw a natural solution. If this happens with 3, 4 var examples, how could someone solve one 100-var instance compounded with other issues?
