@numbersman77 @EpiEllie @domliebl @ildiazm @Janine_Witte @PWGTennant @NoahHaber @JohannesTextor @statnav @ericjdaza @yudapearl @eliasbareinboim 7/n Overlap would mean that p(X=x | W=0)&gt;0 &lt;=&gt; p(X=x | W=1)&gt;0, that we see similar subjects with both treatments. This can hold partially, but is often violated, e.g., if the trial has strict inclusion criteria.
