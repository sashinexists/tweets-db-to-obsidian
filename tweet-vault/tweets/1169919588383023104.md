@Jabaluck @yudapearl @PHuenermund @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal DAGs are quite useful and enlightening. However, I struggle with the idea that there is anything to it other than a representation scheme, isomorphic to many other possible representations. They can be a good tool for setting a common scientific language but not much beyond that.
