@CasualBrady @yudapearl @diogo_pernes Because of colliders. Sometimes you need to close a confounding path, but by doing that, you open a previously closed one. DAG below: no confounding arc between X and Y (X has no children). You need to close backdoors paths from Z. But conditioning on Z, opens the colliding path. https://t.co/t1gAjJlVZT
