@HenningStrandin @ProfLaurenRoss @yudapearl Observational study: Say you observe simultaneous vibrations at node X and Y. Where did the vibration originate? Node X or maybe the unobserved confounder A? What if you could put a finger on A and stop vibrations coming through that way. Would that help you?
