@gilled34 @yudapearl @EinatWilf @newzionists I guess my interpretation of Zionism is from its founder, Herzl, and other leading zionists who are influential on the thinking of modern right wing Zionism (which dominates Israel today), such as Jabotinsky. 

Herzl explicitly states Zionism is a colonial project.
