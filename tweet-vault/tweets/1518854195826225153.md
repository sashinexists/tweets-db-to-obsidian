@GaryMarcus @_pierreblanc @ylecun @StanDehaene @ach3d @lau_devil @Quecalcoatle @Aurelie_JEAN @ygourven @hubertguillaud @olivez @KirkDBorne @le_science4all @freakonometrics @nntaleb @tunguz @IntuitMachine @babgi @EvanKirstel @USBEKetRICA @ycaseau I'm not speaking about "recognizing", I am speaking "understanding" (disappointments), where by "understanding" we mean passing a Turing test about "being disappointed", eg why are you disap., what if the train left on time, would u still be?
