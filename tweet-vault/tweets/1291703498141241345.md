@frankdevocht @cheryl_mcquire @petercraig200 @vkatikireddi @NIHRSPHR @_MiguelHernan @yudapearl @ken_rothman I am therefore somewhat uncomfortable with the division between 'observational study' and 'quasi-experiment' or 'natural-experiment'. For me, this is semantic. And the best approach/tool/estimator is informed by the different challenges of identification &amp; estimation.
