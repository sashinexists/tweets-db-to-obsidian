@Jabaluck @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @yudapearl @MariaGlymour @autoregress But the backlash has now led to a situation where we can't even talk to other Econs because we don't agree what words mean. What does "reduced form" mean? Not nec. how Frank Fisher used it. Econs use "identification" to mean "precise" or "robust". Ack!
