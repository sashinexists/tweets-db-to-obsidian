This guy speaks as if Israel seeks to "retaliate", like kids around the block. He does not get it that the aim is to "prevent," and prevention requires some "disproportionality". What else keeps Hezbollah from launching its 150,000 rockets if not the fear of "disproportionality"? https://t.co/QOllYcw6Pl
