@Jabaluck @AdanZBecerra1 @dmckenzie001 @jenniferdoleac @PHuenermund @causalinf Hence my answer stands: Without formalizing what you mean by "our contextual knowledge" the answer to your question is: It cannot be done. Because, if "context" is some mental DAG, the answer is trivial. If it is not, it could be astrology, premonition, fairy tale -- your pick.
