@PHuenermund @dlmillimet @snavarrol @yudapearl @a40ruhr @causalinf @PossebomVitor @nickchk to say that Angrist is mistaken in his call for transparent identification (and it is @yudapearl who misunderstands Angrist). Or he is not calling for this, in which case he is fundamentally misunderstanding how good empirical research should be done.
