@dileeplearning @adamlewisgreen @GaryMarcus @BethCarey12 @yudapearl but I'm not making any positive argument here. I'm not the one claiming it's impossible in principle for general NN architectures to do X (where X changes every time someone successfully demonstrates X). I think these are all open empirical questions.
