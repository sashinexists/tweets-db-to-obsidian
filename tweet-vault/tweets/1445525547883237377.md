@MarkAnnuncio @stephensenn @PavlosMsaouel @ESteyerberg @LinkedIn @Lester_Domes @MariaGlymour @NP_Jewell @XiaoLiMeng1 Lord's story has no "treatment" nor "assignment" nor "hierarchy". All these terms are borrowed from a different planet. If we stick with "students" "Halls" (="Diets") weights, and who chooses what, clarity will shine.
(I disagree with Hopkins on the definition of "unit")
