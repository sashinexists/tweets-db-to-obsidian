@deborahlipstadt @IzaTabaro This harassment will continue as long as we play their game that, unlike antisemitism, anti-Zionism has forgivable qualities - it doesn't. The harassment will stop when we raise counter-signs saying: "Its worse!" or "Zionophobia kills," perhaps even in lectures on Islamophobia.
