@mg81992 @JGreenblattADL @SpeakerPelosi Funny thing, @SpeakerPelosi need not rebuke the hate-Squad to undo its harm. All she needs to do is speak in first person and repeat what she said 2-3 yrs ago: "For me, Zionism is the most noble project of the 20th Century." The squad will understand the hint, so will their mob.
