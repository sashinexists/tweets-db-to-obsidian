@BetsyOgburn @jiafengchen42 @lihua_lei_stat @VC31415 @artistexyz @ShalitUri @CasualBrady We can't replace "estimand" witn "estimator" for the same reason that you can't replace the "mean" with the (possibly many) "estimator of the mean".  "Causal estimand" is ok for "query", but the latter is so much shorter and refreshing, even a nonstatistician understands it.
