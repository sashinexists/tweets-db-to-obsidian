@yudapearl @pietrobiroli @PHuenermund @instrumenthull @paulgp @dlmillimet @eliasbareinboim Given that you cannot present a clear explanation of what a natural direct effect is, which doesnt rely on the mathematical derivation of the estimator, it’s hardly surprising that you cannot think of a counterexample 🤷🏼‍♀️
