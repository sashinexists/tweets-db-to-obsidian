@NeuroStats @analisereal @paulportesi Thanks @NeuroStats. Great window into the mind of a 1952 statistician who had the courage to admit: "I did not know anything about path analysis...Why?" And this is 30 years after Sewall Wright introduced path analysis and was left to defend it alone.
See #Bookofwhy chapter 2.
