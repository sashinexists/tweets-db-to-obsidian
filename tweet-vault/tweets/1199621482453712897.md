@EpiEllie @rohitpojha @AbbyCScience @Lester_Domes @_MiguelHernan @casualinfer The podcast appears useful to many in the audience. But humble me still wonder what error would I make if I continue to view RCT as in #Bookofwhy, ie, a means to interrogate nature, not a target in itself, and I view my target to be a policy, not a trial. Where would I go wrong?
