@ChrisSeveren @metrics52 I have "Master Metrics" (2015) on my Kindle. Is that representative of the culture? or is "Mostly Harmless" more advanced? I am not surprise that the language in which you "grow up" comes naturally. The question is how flexible the culture is to language enrichment #Bookofwhy
