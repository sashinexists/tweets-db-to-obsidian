@yudapearl @unsorsodicorda Generally it’s the same as standard causal inference just more sophisticated models: given qualitative assumptions on the dynamical eqns, plus assump. on what is observed or not, can some underlying (causal) quantity of interest be estimated? What’s its value/bound on values etc?
