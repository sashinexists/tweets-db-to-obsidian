@yudapearl @ericjang11 @eliasbareinboim @jasonhartford @dustinvtran @zacharylipton @CsabaSzepesvari @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @ShalitUri Using physics and geometry is one example of model based RL ... using a simulator to forecast what might happen. I don't think we are using the word in the same sense as machine learning or statistical "model" but "model" of the world. e.g. a map is a model of world geometry
