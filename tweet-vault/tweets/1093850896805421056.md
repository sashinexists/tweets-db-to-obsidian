@BL4PublicHealth @mathtick Let's take the question "who r u going 2 recruit?". How do you make this decision?
Dont you take into account what question you need to answer, whether the character of the recruitees impedes or assists your ability to answer that question?
etc., This is what "analysis" is about.
