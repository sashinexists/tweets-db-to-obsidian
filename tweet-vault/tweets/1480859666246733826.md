@artistexyz @yudapearl @causalinf @VC31415 @soboleffspaces This is very interesting. From experience, using non-experimental data in personalization often does more hard than good, mostly because the debiasing methods are often complicated and error prone. I would love to see a simple way of combining experimental and observational data
