@stephensenn @autoregress @AdanZBecerra1 @fledglingStat @robertstats Great!!! #Bookofwhy commends David Cox (1958) for breaking statistical taboos and using a causal expression "affected by". Now, how about covariates measured BEFORE randomization. Are they safe, in purely predictive context? What do the textbooks say? Do you agree with them?
