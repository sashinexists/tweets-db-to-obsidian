@stephensenn @f2harrell @soboleffspaces @SMuellerLab Unfortunately, I have a problem of understanding even the most rudimentary concepts such as "clusters" "non-concurrent" "within study" etc. unless someone translates them to CI vocabulary. Has such translation ever been attempted? Can we start with A,B and O ?
as I asked Frank.
