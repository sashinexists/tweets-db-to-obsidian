@GunnarBlohm @KordingLab @sweichwald @dan_marinazzo Not sure what a "correlation method" is? DCM is intended to model causality imo. It is explicitly causal. Where it fails is that it is applied to a highly complex system and only represents a fraction of it. Attempts have been made to address that: https://t.co/YvwwxM3rTF
