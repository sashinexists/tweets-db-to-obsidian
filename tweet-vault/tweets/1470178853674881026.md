@ChristosArgyrop @stephensenn @f2harrell @soboleffspaces @AndrewPGrieve @PavlosMsaouel The question is whether NNT is deficient because it was never properly formulated, or because there is no demand for patient's judgment as to what risk he/she is willing to take.
If there is a demand, the question is how to describe to a lay-patient the risks-benefits involved.
