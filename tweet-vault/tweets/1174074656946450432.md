@jprwg @strangecosmos @GaryMarcus @ylecun Knowledge (or "information") is what constrains your answers and drives them from  "maybe" to yes/no or probable. I am reluctant to use "information" because people tend to confuse it with Shannon's information - a purely probabilistic notion. "Mechanism" is too narrow #Bookofwhy
