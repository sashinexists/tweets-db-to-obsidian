@seanjtaylor @yudapearl IMO, truly observational studies on data should be done, too, given you follow up with RCTs. If you have limited bandwidth for RCTs it can be an valuable if flawed form of information. And not at least trying to learn CATEs from past RCTs using the randomization seems wasteful!
