@LomaahhMore @aynumazi @yudapearl @AOC @deborahlipstadt @bellingcat The IDF is bad at meeting US expectations of transparency. AOC &amp; are often disrespectful of due process. The PA has temporarily run off with the bullet for god knows why. There's no really a great media watchdog. No one behaves admirably in moments like this. It sucks.
