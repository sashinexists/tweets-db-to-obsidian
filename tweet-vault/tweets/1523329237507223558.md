@AdanZBecerra1 @_MiguelHernan @EpiEllie @ProfMattFox @yudapearl Interestingly, I've often seem people deny the arrows in a conceptual diagram represent causes but also not be able to offer any other interpretation of the arrows.  Sometimes though, the arrows represent totally different concepts, eg "time" or just "and also these other things"
