@Noahpinion @MaxGurewitz @tdietterich @StevenGlinert If you never thought stat was at odds with causation, try to explain the absence of "cause" in the index of your favorite stat textbook. Or the inability of your favorite stat professor to write down mathematically: "The rooster crow does not cause the sun to rise". Try it!
