@pierre_rochard @TheStalwart @nic__carter @WhiteRabbitBTC @100trillionUSD @coinmetrics You're very taken with cointegration as proof of causality, but the foremost thinker in the mathematics of causation (@yudapearl) is not. I think proponents of this model should at least acknowledge that such claims of causality are contentious.
