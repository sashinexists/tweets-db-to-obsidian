@tdietterich @neuro_data @KordingLab @tdverstynen @danilobzdok @lakens @TonyZador @ylecun @criticalneuro @IrisVanRooij @neurograce @achristensen56 @AudeOliva @BlackInNeuro @BlackWomenInAI @tyrell_turing reward alone is not going to solve this; DQN has that and still can't reason or adapt.  innate structure that can bootstrap more sophisticated learning might solve this. some other approach to grounding might. a system that could induce variables might. just adding pleasure, no.
