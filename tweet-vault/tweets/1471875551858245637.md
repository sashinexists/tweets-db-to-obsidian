@soboleffspaces @AndrewPGrieve @yudapearl @PavlosMsaouel @f2harrell @smueller @ChristosArgyrop DOE books may be within reach but it seems that not all causal experts are interested. However, if you are an exception, maybe I should splash out the Â£144.99 to buy the book. Will I find an integration of causal and DOE matters (including an appreciation of variation)?
