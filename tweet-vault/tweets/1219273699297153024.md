@yudapearl @thosjleeper @aecoppock I think we agree that such a step (checking IV assumptions against beliefs about the world) is required. But to "focus the discussion" on the assumptions encoded in a DAG is to redirect it from a thornier problem of finding promising candidates in the first place.
