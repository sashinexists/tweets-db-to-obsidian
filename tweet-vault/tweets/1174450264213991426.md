@learnfromerror @JadePinkSameera @StatModeling @stephensenn @Lester_Domes @_MiguelHernan @PhilDawid No I do not overgeneralize. When I wrote "show no interest" I did not mean "have no interest", I meant "show"!! In writings, in meetings, etc. Can we count the number of times the word "causal" appeared in your recent summer symposium? Why deny "show no interest"?#Bookofwhy
