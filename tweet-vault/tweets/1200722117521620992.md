@omaclaren @Lester_Domes @EpiEllie @ConiByera @LucyStats @AlexaYakubovich @AnjaLeist @rohitpojha @AbbyCScience @_MiguelHernan @casualinfer Fisher, "You really want to "compare" the new yield to last year's yield, don't you?" Me: "Never mind what I do with that information, it's my business, just tell me E[Y(x=1)]". Fisher quits, and I remain offering 100 Euro to any statistician who can predict E[Y(x=1)]. #Bookofwhy
