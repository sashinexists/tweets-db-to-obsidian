@atypical_me @KordingLab @sweichwald @dan_marinazzo The idea is that there are many d.o.f. for different models to produce the same behaviour. Eve Marder addresses that in her research explicitly. Models are either so detailed (i.e. realistic) that you have too many fit parameters or too simple (many alternative models)
