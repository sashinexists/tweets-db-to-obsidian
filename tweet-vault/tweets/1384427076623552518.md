This is amazing, it's me and my second cousin Theodor Bickel! Where did you get it, Dennis? One of my most cherished memory is singing "We were here!"  with Theo; I sang in Hebrew "Anachnu Po!" and he did in Yiddish "Mir Zeinen Do". He passed away six  years ago and I miss him. https://t.co/r5ikuOp7jn
