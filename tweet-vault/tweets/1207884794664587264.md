@Jabaluck @yudapearl @metrics52 Hi Jason,

A genuine question:

Could you point out an applied article in an Econ journal  (which is not a meta-analysis) that:

* establishes an empirical result
* discusses extrnl validity of this result in a formal framework and arrives at conclusion that you find credible?
