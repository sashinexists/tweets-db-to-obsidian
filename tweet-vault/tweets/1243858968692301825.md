@Muenchner_Junge @yudapearl I did not know about it! Thanks for sharing. Itâ€™s a pity however not to have the lectures themselves there. The script helps, the slides too, but I miss the lectures and a place to discuss the topics. On online course with lectures, exercises and a forum for discussions is great!
