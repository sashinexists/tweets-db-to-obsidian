I have pre-ordered the book, due August, but I love the elephant parable. Why? Because I was in the opinion that I present a "logic of causation"
(see https://t.co/4fPshHecjC) not "an approach", whereas the blindmen (eg PO, ML, Prob., possible worlds) represent "approaches". https://t.co/YM7GgZst91
