@yudapearl @Lester_Domes @EpiEllie @ConiByera @LucyStats @AlexaYakubovich @AnjaLeist @rohitpojha @AbbyCScience @_MiguelHernan @casualinfer Out of curiosity, if Y(X=x) is constant for all x, would you put an arrow from X to Y in a DAG? Does X have to change the value of Y under some conceivable circumstances to count as a cause?
