Thanks for reminding us indeed that Palestinian call for boycott started 1936 by Hitler's confidante, al-Husseini, whose riots of 1936-39 compelled Britain to prevent Jews from reaching safety, sealing their fate. It was the first boycott-induced genocide in history. Hail to BDS! https://t.co/SixVBdQIAR
