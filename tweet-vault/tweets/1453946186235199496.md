@yudapearl @epistwatchtower @PHuenermund @holdmytowel “Monism” is often by the fearful, to assuage their terror of acknowledging that there is no single right way to carve the world at its joints. It reminds me of the Alchemists who thought lead could be made into gold because both are constructed of the same basic constituents.
