@atypical_me @GunnarBlohm @KordingLab @dan_marinazzo Can you clarify the difference between a causal and a statistical model?
A statistical model has parameters and models one joint distribution over variables; a causal model has parameters and models a set of joint distributions, one for each intervention.
