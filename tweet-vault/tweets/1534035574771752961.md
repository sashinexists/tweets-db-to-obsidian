I remember D-Day. No, I wasn't on a boat, I was only 8 yr old. But I remember my father rushing home with a newspaper screaming: HaPlisha Hechela (The Invasion Started), and everyone gathered around the newspaper which had a huge headline: Haplisha Hechela. All I knew: it's BIG. https://t.co/t854iCQUM0
