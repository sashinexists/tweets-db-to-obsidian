@robertwplatt @PHuenermund @Jabaluck @maximananyev I do not see anything missing. More and more people get the idea that you use DAGs to encode what you know and PO to express what you wish to know, and that we now have the logic of going from the former to the latter. The rest is up to subject matter experts. #Bookofwhy
