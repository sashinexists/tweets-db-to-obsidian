As we can see from wikipedia, the concept of "ceteris paribus" is slippery, depending on its usage and on how formal you want to be. But eon are lucky, because they start with SEM, which is a mathematical object, in terms of which other concepts can be defined, including CP. https://t.co/uwj4BeBD0L
