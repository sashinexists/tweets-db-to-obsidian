@bayesianboy @yudapearl If the set of variables in a Bayes net can be infinite, then the number of Markov blankets will be uncountable, right? Proof (?): Suppose that every variable V1, ..., Vi, ... either arrows into V0 or not. That's an uncountable # of graphs. For each, there is a distinct MB for V0.
