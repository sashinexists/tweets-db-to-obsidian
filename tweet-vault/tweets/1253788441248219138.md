@maximananyev @Jabaluck @yudapearl I agree with you that ”This is my DAG, hence this strategy works” will often fail. 

But DAGs help in probing id assumptions. “Isn’t this DAG reasonable?”, “Can we conceivably delete this arrow?”. 

The key conceptual change is to see SCMs as fundamental, and POs as derived.
