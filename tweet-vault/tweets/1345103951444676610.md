If I were a philanthropist, I would naturally donate another building for "Tree-climbing-science". But not when we have a mathematical proof that "trees are too short". Sadly, donors do not read proofs, and tree-climbers enjoy the climb, the low-hanging fruits &amp; the nth building. https://t.co/tLFdIO1fPY
