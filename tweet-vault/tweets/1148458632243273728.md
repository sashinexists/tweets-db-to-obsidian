@Jabaluck @yudapearl @autoregress @MariaGlymour @PHuenermund @EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer @metrics52 Whether or not a problem comes from a textbook or from the "real world", you're solving it- or trying to anyway- with the same mind. The (implicit) claim that these issues magically disappear when you go from toy models to research is, to put it mildly, unconvincing.
