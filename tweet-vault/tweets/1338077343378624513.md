Can you believe it? This is #Dubai! and this is Chanukah! The holiday that even @nytimes couldn't stomach, and for a good reason. Chanukah is the most visible refutation of the picture the @nytimes editors are trying to paint of Israel and of Jewish history. Thank you, Chanukah! https://t.co/hU3Nn9ZYpY
