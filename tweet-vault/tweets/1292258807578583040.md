You’re right, we didn’t mention Hizbollah

But nor do we mention any of the political parties or actors that, collectively &amp; cynically, are responsible for the catastrophe that’s befallen the country

‘All means All’ is how the Lebanese people put it.  Couldn’t be said any better https://t.co/C1RXHdzFmh
