@causalinf @hyperplanes @dade_us There are no submission charges, and article processing charges are voluntary. Those who can afford it, pay, and those who can't, just need to say so. And, again, considering the unique culture and ideas nourished by JCI, its a real bargain, unmatched by any contender.
