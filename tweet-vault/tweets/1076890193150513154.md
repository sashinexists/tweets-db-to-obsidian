@yudapearl @IntJObesity @_MiguelHernan @miquelporta @causalityblog @yudapearl, interesting question. "when Hippasus of Metapontum proved that there are irrational numbers, they threw him overboard" is a conjunction of assumptions. Nobody knows if that's true. "Why" do you accept the conclusion:"they could not stomach their own logical  tools"?
