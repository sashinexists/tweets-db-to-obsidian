@stephensenn @soboleffspaces @AndrewPGrieve @PavlosMsaouel @f2harrell @smueller @ChristosArgyrop @Genstat I am yearning for principles, not algorithms. How could Nelder deal (mathematically) with causation in 1965, 10 years before Rubin's PO language? Sending me to 1965 does not help. We are in 2021 when, fortunately, we can communicate principles in Twitter's efficiency.
