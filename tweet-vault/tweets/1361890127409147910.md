@Jabaluck @AdanZBecerra1 @dmckenzie001 @jenniferdoleac @PHuenermund @causalinf If economists are trying to solve the problem of deciding which DAG is preferred, without telling us what knowledge they invoke in their "design", then I DO HAVE a solution to it. And the answer is "it cannot be done". This is not an opinion but a theorem. Logic is helpful.
