@yudapearl @RandomlyWalking @raamana_ Thanks @yudapearl We need researchers who speak both ML and CI. Right now, the two communities seem to be talking past each other. Iâ€™m biased but @_asubbaswamy is exactly such a researcher; would be great for younger researchers who are leading the way to get more talk space.
