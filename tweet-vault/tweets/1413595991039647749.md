Well put, @ShMMor, I have been waiting for someone to tell @PeterBeinart up front that he is no longer a *member* of the Jewish people. He has excommunicated himself by disavowing the one bond that tie us together: Jewish history and its dream for normalcy, culminating in Israel. https://t.co/lHEGrMhgdS
