@yudapearl @Ya3il8200 @blakeflayton @IfNotNowOrg Again, I think thatâ€™s an unfair generalization about Arabs. And regardless, Hamas, Iran, etc. will continue with that rhetoric regardless of whether the West Bank is occupied. Israel as well take the step toward peace and improving the quality of life of West Bank Palestinians.
