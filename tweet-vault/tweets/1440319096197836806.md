@RaniaKassi @gilled34 @EinatWilf @newzionists Last time I looked at the mirror I saw a modern &amp; enlightened person, highly knowledgeable in how Israel was formed (I was there) and how it is sustained (miraculously) against all attempts to annihilate it. I've also noticed a glaring asymmetry in the art of dehumanizing others.
