@JFronczekMD @soboleffspaces @yudapearl @AndrewPGrieve @suiss70 @miquelporta @f2harrell 5. Observation data is cheap and easy to collect. It is collected anyway before most RCT. If observational data contradicts RCT, then you designed a flawed RCT. I would redo everything , both observational and RCT, until i found out what was the problem.
