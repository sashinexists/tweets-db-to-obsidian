@ylecun @tejasdkulkarni @_WEEXIAO @Vlad_S @drfeifei @yudapearl @neurobongo @TimKietzmann @demishassabis @sama @ilyasut @koraykv @AndrewYNg &amp; as I have said repeatedly, the challenge is to bring together symbolic operations (like copy, compare, etc) and symbolic knowledge with learning systems :)
