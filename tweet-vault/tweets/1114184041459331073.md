@eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @juli_schuess @Jabaluck @CarterPaddy I certainly don't want to give the impression that my proof is original! Again I wonder what Elias meant by "If the two systems are equivalent, I assume one can solve a toy example with 3-4 variables (e.g. front-door, napkin) using the alternative language?" Surely one can!
