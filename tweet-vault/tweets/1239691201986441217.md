I end my tweets with #Bookofwhy because, so I am told, many readers filter their tweets by this tag, and I do not want them to be left out of the discussion. It is not meant to suggest that the book "solves every problem"; an epsilon of commonsense would rule out such suggestions https://t.co/i1DTGXK1MF
