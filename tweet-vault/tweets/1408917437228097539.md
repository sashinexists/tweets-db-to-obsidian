@Cricket62522188 @MartinKonecny @LahavHarkov Don't tell me Palestinians are irrational people. Palestinian parents must explain to their children what "From the River to the Sea" means, and why they never did, nor will accept co-existence. Children are not stupid; the only rational explanation is: "Tel Aviv was Stolen".
