@nntaleb @yudapearl @HarryDCrane @nntaleb Can you clerify what is probabilistic causality? How can we know any other?

BTW, I think that @yudapearl 's work makes it easy to avoid getting fooled by berksons/simpsons and to avoid treating conditional data as uncond., All huge mistakes in most "research" today
