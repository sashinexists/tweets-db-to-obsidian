Not exactly. "Blaming" does not help anyone. What the talk tried to summarize is: (1) We can identify which assumption may be responsible for the failure and submit it for further tests or refinement and (2) Replacing assumptions with data will not do us any good. No alternative! https://t.co/zYvxd2h9qt
