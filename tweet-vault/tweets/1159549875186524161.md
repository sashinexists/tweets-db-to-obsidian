@steventberry @paulgp @lewbel @yudapearl Maybe this is the conversation that forces me to be more coherent in my book and commit to certain terms. My book doesnâ€™t mince words that I think @yudapearl is correct that estimation requires assumptions and data. But Imbens is explicit about that too. 4/5
