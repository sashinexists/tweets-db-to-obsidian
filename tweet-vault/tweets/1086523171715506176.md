@statwonk @bajwa_jamal @nntaleb I don't think even Gelman would classify #causalinference methods as "qualitative".
Yes, the input knowledge is qualitative (ie, "who depends on whom") but the output is an "estimand", namely, a RECIPE for processing data to get a QUANTITATIVE answer to our question. #Bookofwhy
