@CAMERAorg @CNN @dmlitman The CNN series on Jerusalem is disgusting not because it is one-sided but because the Israeli side describes honestly how it felt living those events while the other side decries the evil INTENTIONS Israelis must have had, still have, and must be punished for having. Disgusting
