@RWJE_BA @soboleffspaces @yudapearl @VC31415 @causalinf @smueller @Ang_UCLA But that is not what Pearl proclaims. Pearl's theory is very deeply rooted in experiments. Those causal models are scientific hypotheses that can and should be tested. Pearl's CI when properly practiced follows the scientific method.
