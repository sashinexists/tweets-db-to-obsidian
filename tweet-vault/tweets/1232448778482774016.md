@yudapearl @ylecun @NoelSharkey @GaryMarcus Yes! Thanks for Price &amp; Demand example! The counterfactual query was what I had in mind - can this be extended to cycles involving n vars (n&gt;2) ? By knowing the value of n-1 vars at the current &amp; next time steps and thus getting the expected value of the last var?
