I am always surprised to see people surprised upon hearing  Palestinians repeat what they have been saying since 1920: "No room for coexistence." Is it because we alluded ourselves: "It's a small minority" or "They don't really mean it"? They meant it! And never had a minority! https://t.co/iwszAXU54p
