@yudapearl @tom4everitt @RWJE_BA @nickinpractice @davidad @eliasbareinboim @victorveitch @RichardMCNgo @SmithaMilli @ryancareyai @gusl Thanks for sharing these. It looks like our results are very similar (we focus on refining the expected utility into harm and benefit instead of the ATE). One extra little result in ours that you may be interested in, and will extend to your work, is a no-go theorem ðŸ§µ
