@PHuenermund @yudapearl @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal You make a second point about using DAGs to synthesize the literature and transmit knowledge over time. This point (which you've made many times) is interesting, but I am skeptical as it overstates the confidence with which any arrow is ever "proven" or "known" in research.
