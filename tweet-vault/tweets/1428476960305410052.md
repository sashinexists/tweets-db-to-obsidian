@analisereal @pablogerbas @alexpghayes @MatheusFacure @yudapearl Going back to the start, I interpret Pearl saying Matheus has not adequately learned causal inference because he  hasn't studied its most general formulation. This implies learning a less general formulation is somehow deficient, but deficiency depends on the application.
