@jmwooldridge @steventberry Given the one-to-one mapping between SEM and PO, the usage of one or the other is a choice of which you prefer to keep implicit. In small problems you can afford to keep SEM in your head, in large ones you can't. Imbens says: most eco problems are small. I doubt it's by choice.
