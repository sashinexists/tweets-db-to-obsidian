Where is the British Emil Zola to write a 2021 "J'accuse!" - "I accuse the BBC, its editors, its writers, producers etc. of conspiracy to deceive the British public..." But who will publish it? The Guardian? The Independence?. This is not Paris of 1898, it's Corbyn's London. https://t.co/8cgfvFarNZ
