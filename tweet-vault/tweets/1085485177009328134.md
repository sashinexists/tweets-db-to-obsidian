@yudapearl @tdietterich @GaryMarcus @Grady_Booch @RichardSocher Hassabis makes the argument that Deep RL is extrapolation.  Deep RL would align with the second rung in your ladder.  Through interaction an understanding of a system is discovered. He alludes to a continuum that perhaps extends to inventiveness. @demishassabis
