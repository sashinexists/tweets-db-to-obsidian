@yudapearl @timnitGebru @Aaroth @mmitchell_ai @profelisacelis @red_abebe @NisheethVishnoi @mkearnsupenn now regardless of people, the view that "topics that fall under ethics are low technical topics" is dangerous and wrong, and if I may add, ignores the history of our fields: Algerba and Algorithms originate in a book of which half the content is about "justice" in the 9th century
