@dlmillimet @snavarrol @Jabaluck @yudapearl @a40ruhr @causalinf @PossebomVitor @nickchk Definitely not bullet proof. But I think the added transparency would facilitate the discussion enormously. We can now talk about specific edges and possible mediators along the paths. That would be helpful especially in designs with conditional IVs.
