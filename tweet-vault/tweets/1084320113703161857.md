@omaclaren @statwonk @yudapearl @PHuenermund Ok, then, why don't u assume your position &amp; make it explicit? OM: "I don't find your setting interesting." I am just trying to get your honest take, but u don't want to commit either way. Obviously, I think such a smt would be amazing (ludicrous), but u can't have it both ways.
