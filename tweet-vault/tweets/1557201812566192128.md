@yudapearl @axel_red_third Just read it. It's very balance. I agree with you that the fear of Jewish homeland is zinophobia. But that doesn't mean that any Jew or individual or organisation that critize Isreal policy towards Palestinians is zinophobic unless they are against Isreal's right to exist.
