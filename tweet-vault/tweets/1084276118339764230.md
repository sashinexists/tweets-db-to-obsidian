@yudapearl @PHuenermund Suppose the model is of the atmosphere and ground and included rain physics. Then yes you can ask for the causal effect of rain on mud formation. Similarly the causal assumptions include that mud does not cause rain, though conservation of mass requires some water to be absorbed
