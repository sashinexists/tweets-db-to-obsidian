@PWGTennant @eliasbareinboim @_MiguelHernan @rdpeng @EpiEllie Likewise, save for two problems: (1) Where do we place "diagnosis" (eg Bayes' billiard Table) which is not "prediction" and it needs no intervention? (2) Suppose we can run RCT on every variable, can we estimate countefactuals? eg ETT, "but-for", CoE mediation, etc. #Bookofwhy
