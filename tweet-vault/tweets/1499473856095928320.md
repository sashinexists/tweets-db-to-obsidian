@ADAlthousePhD @stephensenn @f2harrell @soboleffspaces @SMuellerLab Frankly, assuming RCT experts do not have a formal framework to capture their intricate considerations, it would be very wise of them to benefit from the tools developed in CI, or any other formal framework in existence. Why not? Professional pride?
