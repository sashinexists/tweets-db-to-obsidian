@HL327 @stephensenn @soboleffspaces @JFronczekMD @EpiEllie @f2harrell @ADAlthousePhD @artistexyz @statsepi @GuyattGH @GRADE_WG Our analysis makes no assumption about the mechanism behind the data, save for the assumption that the RCT is ideal (no selection bias). You get different results by assuming some mechanism. Can you explain the difference? Is your RCT ideal? I'm under deadline pressures today.
