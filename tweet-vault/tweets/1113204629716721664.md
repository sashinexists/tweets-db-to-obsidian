@aricaroline @causalinf @Jabaluck Very reasonable, and I hope @causalinf finds the time and inspiration to do it. However, my golden rule is: One example "of it" is worth ten debates "about it". I say so because I have seen many flip overnight as soon as they solved one toy example hands on using DAGs. #Bookofwhy
