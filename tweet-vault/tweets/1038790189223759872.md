@DavidSFink @yudapearl @EpiEllie So are you saying if we don’t call sex a cause we won’t invest in creative ways to deal with issues related to sex? If so, that seems fair to me, but this doesn’t seem like a scientific argument, more a political one (which may be reason enough). Sorry if I missed the point.
