@AdrianBauman @JamesSteeleII @SamueleMarcora @harryrutter @cavilln @fiona_bull @WHOBulletin Having seen painful problems induced by vague terms such as "interrelatedness" I am now more cautious, to the point that my mind demands to know what makes direct relatedness different from indirect relatedness.
