@MarkAnnuncio @stephensenn @PavlosMsaouel @ESteyerberg @LinkedIn @Lester_Domes @MariaGlymour @NP_Jewell @XiaoLiMeng1 I explained why I must excuse myself https://t.co/3j7EKX7o8U
1. It's not a "study" it's a story.
2. Yes! As was clearly stated.
3. "Clustering" is an "experimental design" notion.
   Forbidden in our discussions, unless translated to behavior of students in their environment.
