@kinggary @LydiaManiatis @CMichaelGibson @joshgeleris @CNN @NEJM The PS weaknesses that @kinggary unveils are orthogonal to those I explicate in https://t.co/BYnjoEsn8D. The former are weakness of estimation, the latter of identification (infinite sample). Curious: what is "fully blocked randomized experiment" that you compare PS to?
