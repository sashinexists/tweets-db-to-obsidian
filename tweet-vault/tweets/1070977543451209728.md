@statnav @EpiEllie @zshahn @_MiguelHernan @PhilDawid To this one can add my commentary on Dawid's paper, https://t.co/gs5U5OQ86Y in which I labor hard to convince him that questions about Causes of Effects must invoke counterfactuals, and
that, contrary to Rubin's teachings, this does not make them less scientific. #Bookofwhy.
