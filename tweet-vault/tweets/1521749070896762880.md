What in the world is NOT a a flagrant attack on the holy sites of Muslims? Can we breath? Eat? Our after-meal blessing says: "He will walk us in sovereignty to our land". Is that "a flagrant attack on the holy sites of Muslims?" What's  holy for people w/ no respect for others? https://t.co/CCWaUVc77i
