@Jabaluck @btshapir @paulnovosad @yudapearl I have read some papers using panel regression methods, which are likely to fail to capture quantities of interest. Also, on twitter I've seen (top) researchers confused on whether/how to adjust for mediators in these cases, problems that have been addressed in the literature.
