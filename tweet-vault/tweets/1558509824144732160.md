@soboleffspaces @artistexyz @yudapearl @johnmark_taylor @ylecun @GaryMarcus I understand, there is no tension at all from your perspective :) From the establishment perspective: 95% of the data is observational (layer L1), &amp; 90% of the claims one wants to make are about intervention/counterfactuals (L 2/3) [eb numbers]; how to reconcile?
