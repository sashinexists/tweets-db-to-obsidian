@yudapearl @intensivemargin @CarterPaddy @mkessler_DC @t0nyyates Sorry, what is alpha here? If you’re saying, drawing a DAG is useful, I agree. If you’re saying you can only answer some questions with do-calculus, I have trouble swallowing that. Anyway, @metrics52 might have a better response to this.
