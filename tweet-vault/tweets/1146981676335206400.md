@yudapearl @causalinferenc @_MiguelHernan It’s not a simple question, so there’s no simple answer. Before drawing a DAG I think through what my causal question is, and I add variables when I know what they mean. That doesn’t mean blood pressure could never be on a DAG, but you can’t just throw things on without thinking.
