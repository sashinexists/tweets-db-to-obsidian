@symmo1969 @jeremycorbyn Populist clich√©s. You would never (repeat: never) find me  use the term "antisemitic" in any discussion of Israel. The term "Zionophobic" serves much better to expose the bigotry and genocidal aims of those who are dehumanizing a people under the cover of "criticism of Israel".
