@AndersHuitfeldt @f2harrell Right. We are dealing with non-parametric models which, by nature, allow unrestricted heterogeneity. I therefore presume that if "interaction" plays aany role, it must be that one is working in some parametric model, which I missed. Can we clarify afresh what the problem is?
