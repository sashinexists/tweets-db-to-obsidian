@Jabaluck @yudapearl @PHuenermund @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal Instead what I would do is mediation analysis to partition the total effect of race on outcomes into direct and indirect effects mediated by treatment. I would simulate what the differences in outcome would be if we equalized treatment between minorities and whites.
