@yudapearl @stephensenn @f2harrell @goodmanmetrics @JadePinkSameera @ShannonBrownlee @vamrhein @dailyzad @METRICStanford @learnfromerror @MariaGlymour @CMichaelGibson @PTetlock @hmkyale @_MiguelHernan Mostly finite-sample properties of specific estimators under shrinkage assumptions not visible in typical cDAGs, eg response can be approximated adequately by a given parametric curve.
