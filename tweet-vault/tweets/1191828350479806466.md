@yudapearl @AdanZBecerra1 @fledglingStat @robertstats Not adjusting for variables that are associated with outcomes because they are unassociated with exposure can be a fundamental mistake. This philosophy would allow one to analyse a randomised block design as if it were completely randomised. This is a fail in Stat 1
