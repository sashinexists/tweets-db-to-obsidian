@alexdamour @yudapearl @CsabaSzepesvari @mendel_random 4/4 On transparency, I quote (p. 2, https://t.co/4RObSfxTBY): "...assumptions are self-destructive in their honesty. The more explicit the assumption, the more criticism it invites, for it tends to trigger a richer space of alternative scenarios in which the assumption may fail."
