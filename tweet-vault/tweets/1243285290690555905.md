@davidpapineau @totteh @rabois @seanjtaylor The nice thing about modern thinking is that you can tell orthogonality w/o even reading the paper. Just look at the equations, if all they have is probabilistic expressions, no do(x) and no counterfactual subscripts - forget it, its traditional statistics, no causation#Bookofwhy
