A thoughtful essay by @YehudaKurtzer on the ideological basis for continued Jewish-Muslim dialogue. This was indeed the basis for the Daniel Pearl Muslim-Jewish dialogue that Professor Akbar Ahmed and I have been conducting 2002-2012. Perhaps 2022 may be a good time for renewal? https://t.co/CyUcIDzPCw
