@yudapearl We missed you that summer at @UncertaintyInAI and @RealAAAI. I organized a workshop at UAI, AAAI, and @kdd_news with @erichorvitz, Gene Santos, and Haipeng Guo, and we dedicated the proceedings this. I always wanted to show you this.

Now and always, may his memory be a blessing. https://t.co/Vc5MlkHLms
