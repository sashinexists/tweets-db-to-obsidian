@JeffDenning @causalinf @btshapir @Jabaluck @juli_schuess @yskout I got a copy of Mostlyharmless and, if this book is representative of
the "credibility revolution", I find it hard to understand how anyone who tried to solve a problem with dags can attached the word "credibiity" to a methodology that ignores our models of reality. #Bookofwhy
