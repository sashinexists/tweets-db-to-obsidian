@VC31415 I wonder what @yudapearl thinks of this interpretation. In Fig 1.5 of "Causality," the market equilibrium model of (P,Q) is represented by a cyclic graph in which supply runs from Q-&gt;P and demand from P-&gt;Q.  I always thought this to be too restrictive: https://t.co/APccxZYDtD https://t.co/bQFZwd2RXs
