@johndawkins @athie_gnome @gibletsMoon @rasmansa No.. there are plenty of non-linear methods for correlation. In fact, Pearson’s correlation is so limited, that one really should default to Spearman’s instead, particularly given that you only lose a little sensitivity to linear relationships w Spearman.
