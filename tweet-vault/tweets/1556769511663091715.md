@yudapearl @pietrobiroli @PHuenermund @instrumenthull @paulgp @dlmillimet @eliasbareinboim This isnt correct though. It’s not about fixing the mediator at it’s pre-intervention value. It’s about setting the mediator to the value it would have had, post intervention, in the absence of intervention, for that specific individual. That may or may NOT be the same as before
