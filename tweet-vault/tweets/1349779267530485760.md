@yudapearl @yskout @PHuenermund The DAG has super-nodes. The full model is dynamic -- a composition of 90 DAGs. It is used to clarify what different  one-step ahead regressions are estimating (direct, indirect effects).  Counterfactual computations are therefore custom-made. Maybe can be made automated one-day.
