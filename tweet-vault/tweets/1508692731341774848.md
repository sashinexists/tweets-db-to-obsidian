@soboleffspaces @yudapearl @nickchk @Lizstuartdc @PWGTennant No it is not. Breaking thermometers does not influence temperature, thatâ€™s why causal knowledge is needed and correlation is not enough. DAGs are (Markov-) equivalent iif they have the same skeleton and the same unmarried parents. One needs a causal DAG to model a causal world.
