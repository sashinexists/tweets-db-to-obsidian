@EpiEllie @pietrobiroli @PHuenermund @instrumenthull @paulgp @dlmillimet @eliasbareinboim The Natural Direct Effect (NDE) of X on Y is the expected change of Y in the transition from X=0 to X=1, while keeping the mediator Z fixed, i.e., at whatever value Z had before the transition. It is easier than CDE, where you have to decide and justify at what value to fix Z.
