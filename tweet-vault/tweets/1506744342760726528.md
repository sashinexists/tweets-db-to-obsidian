@Martin_Kramer @J_d_parker It's not even academic boycott; show me one respectable university that would comply with MESA's call. It's "intellectual bullying", telling Zionist students and faculty: "Renounce your identity if you want our holy company". Pushback: "We do not need your unholy company."
