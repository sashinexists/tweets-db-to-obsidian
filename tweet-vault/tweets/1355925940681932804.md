@andpru @KordingLab @danilobzdok @NeuroStats @koerding @neuro_data @GaelVaroquaux Who could imagine that the Bristol group, so fearful of the "tyranny of DAGs" https://t.co/HQWctOvt9Y, would be the one to explain "collider bias" to Nature readers. Next we should expect them to explain backdoor, external validity, mediation, etc. etc. DAGs do Wag their Tails.
