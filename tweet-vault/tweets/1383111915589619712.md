I also like @CarlosCinelli explanation, and it is amazing how hard it is for people to accept the fact that single case explanations cannot be based on population averages. This is probably due to historical resistance in the PO sub-cultures to the Rung 2 vs. Rung 3 distinction. https://t.co/5rUaLszFgz
