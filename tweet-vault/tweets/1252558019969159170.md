@RWerpachowski @Spinozasrose I did not think you said it in a mean way. My point still is that, in order for the memory of the Holocaust to be long lasting we must tie it with revival and rebirth. And I do not think the directors of our 60 Museums understand it; you can hardly see a glimpse of Israel in any.
