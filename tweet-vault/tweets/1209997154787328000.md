@ylecun @BethCarey12 @GaryMarcus @tdietterich Just for the music: Replace DL with "regression", and see how things still stick, and the music is still flowing soundly and harmoniously, even more so, for we know so much about "regression" and its limitations. BUT: Is "regression" is the right scientific model? NO! #Bookofwhy
