First day with NO Covid-19 deaths! I think it is a remarkable achievement and a hopeful sign for all of us. It is also remarkable that so highly divided country, with essentially no functioning government, can nevertheless unite and overcome a danger, when push comes to shove. https://t.co/er248oYzPl
