@LomaahhMore @aynumazi @yudapearl @AOC @deborahlipstadt @bellingcat It's really just aggravating Haaretz doesn't give a free article a month or something. lol. And the fact that it's just impossibly hard to find truly objective reporting on the region. Al Jazeera is astoundingly biased. Times of Israel doesn't do serious investigation.
