@FJnyc @intelligence2 @EWilf @bariweiss @SethAMandel @DanielBShapiro @ZionessMovement @WarpedMirrorPMB @LTCPeterLerner @HillelNeuer @BretStephensNYT @MsJulieLenarz @LahavHarkov Mehdi Hasan will continue to stage these Kangaroo debates until someone charges him with "Zionophobic bigotry" in front of an audience, which would corner him to compare his perpetual denial of Jewish identity as people with his perpetual whining of "Islamophobic bigotry."
