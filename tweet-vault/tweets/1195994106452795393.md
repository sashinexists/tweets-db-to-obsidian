@RonKenett @stephensenn @learnfromerror I look back at my Tweet and find nothing there about causality, just an innocent question: "what makes 'age' a better block than say 'hair color'?" . How do you explain to students in class, BEFORE seeing any data, that the former would be better for estimation. #Bookofwhy
