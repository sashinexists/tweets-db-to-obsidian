@stephensenn @ADAlthousePhD @PavlosMsaouel @GustafRydevik @f2harrell @soboleffspaces @SMuellerLab The way forward is not to ask what I read or not read, but to communicate how you normally specify (mathematically) (1) a research question, (2) a RCT finding, (3) the assumptions that permit you to go from (2) to (1), and (4) the machinery of doing (3).
All it takes is 4 lines.
