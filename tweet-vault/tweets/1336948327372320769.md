@autoregress @eliasbareinboim @Jabaluck @PHuenermund The main conceptual blunder is the total absence of SCM (Structural Causal Models), of which DAGs are but a graphical abstraction and in terms of which potential outcomes are defined. Thus, whatever capabilities one attributes to PO, those same capabilities are realizable in SCM.
