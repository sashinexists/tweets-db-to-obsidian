Passing or withdrawing a resolution matters not. What matter is having a stage, a microphone, and a discussion about the racist character of an accused. The "accused" in this case should be student organizations that malign identity symbols of other students. (eg Koran, Israel). https://t.co/VMvHVeeqac
