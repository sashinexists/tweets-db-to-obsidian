@MaartenvSmeden @statsmethods @PWGTennant @yudapearl @TRIPODStatement Agree. But more thought goes into brainless imputation (because itâ€™s at least an acknowledgement that there is missing data) than brainless no acknowledgement.  Thanks for highlighting @TRIPODStatement - our E&amp;E paper also goes in to this in more detail (https://t.co/YP3ZEboNbI)
