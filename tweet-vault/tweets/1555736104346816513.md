@instrumenthull @PHuenermund @paulgp @dlmillimet @pietrobiroli @yudapearl @eliasbareinboim I will probably not do her argument justice so I won’t try. But the gist of it is that making decisions “because of” race (as distinct from other things) is no more conceptually well founded that thinking about the “causal impact” of race.
