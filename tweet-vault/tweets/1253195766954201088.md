@autoregress @gelbach @Jabaluck @HeerJeet Puzzled. How could economists  possibly have fought this or a similar war, if they did not have a 3-rung causal hierarchy in mind, nor complete tools for managing each rung. Can you point me to any similar war? Was "moving on" a resolution or "give up, lets do what we do best???"
