EEOC determined that @CUNYkcc pervasively discriminated against &amp; excluded Zionist Jews. 

@CUNYKCCPRES  "addressing" it with a new DEI officer search. She is refusing to allow Zionist Jews to serve on the search committee. Instead, she has appointed a vocal BDS advocate to it. https://t.co/nL4Cz5vUAd
