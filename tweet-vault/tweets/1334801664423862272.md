@sbuhai @PhilHaile I would love to believe its true, and it is probably true "in essence". Yet whenever I ask an economist: define the counterfactual Y_x(u), the answer I get: "It's defined since Haavelmo" or "see Hurwicz, Koopmans and others ". Never a definition which just ONE LINE long. Strange!
