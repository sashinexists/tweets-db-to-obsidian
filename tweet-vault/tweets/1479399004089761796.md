@artistexyz @yudapearl @tdietterich @BomNaKub @roydanroy Agreed, but my question was about the actual meaning of do(). If we describe it as an action, we seem to confuse  controlled interventions with non-controlled ones. While, it seems, only the first should be subject to do(). Whence the doubt on Y_x' in PN.
