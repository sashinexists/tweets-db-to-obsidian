@johnurbanik @eliasbareinboim Well taken, and thanks for explaining the positive side of "underspecification" papers. I like your (quote): "Toy examples do not enlighten someone who thinks the solution is just more data." But I think toy examples should be ADDED to explain why more data ain't the solution.
