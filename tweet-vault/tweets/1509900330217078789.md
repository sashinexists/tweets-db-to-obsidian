@eoteromuras @gilbellosta @Picanumeros My Spanish did not allow me to follow the entire conversation, but I would confirm my current opinion that, whenever ML folks say "inductive bias" they mean: "We must rely on domain knowledge, we're not sure how to do it, so we'll call it 'inductive bias', it sounds ML-doable."
