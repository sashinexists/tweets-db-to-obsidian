@atypical_me @GunnarBlohm @KordingLab @dan_marinazzo I agree, causal inference is difficult/often impossible!
I don't think this is an excuse for falsely labeling DCM as causal (as in predicting effects of interventions) "because, hey, causality seems hopeless anyway".
We know it cannot answer such causal questions and must say so.
