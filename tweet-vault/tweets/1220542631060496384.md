@joedotfaith @LucyStats @yudapearl @causalinf Everyone at my company works remotely from different cities. A coworker suggested that we all seem to get sick at the same time anyway. That's a hypothesis we could test and assign a p-value: do multiple employees get sick at the same time more than chance.
