@cdsamii @eliasbareinboim @deaneckles @yudapearl (Thanks for the stimulating discussion). I think I agree. For gender/race, we should be more explicit and say "appearance of gender/race" causes things. I still think it's deeper than what the intervention is: It is the question what the variable itself is.
