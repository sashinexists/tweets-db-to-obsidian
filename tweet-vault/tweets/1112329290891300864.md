@PHuenermund @snavarrol @Jabaluck @yudapearl @a40ruhr @causalinf @PossebomVitor @nickchk But I fail to see how DAGs are a solution. I can draw a DAG that shows z is a valid IV and then say “I’m famous and I drew this pic. Ergo, it’s right.” (Well, not me but someone actually famous.). The DAG does not seem to be any more idiot (or ass) proof.
