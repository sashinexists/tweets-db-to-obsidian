@jacobmbuckman @danijarh Thanks for the genuine attempt to submit the paradox for RL solution. However, notice that the same conclusions can be derived on the basis of the data alone, model free, w/o assuming H &amp; M or any variable. Is there any work in RL on combining experimental and observational data?
