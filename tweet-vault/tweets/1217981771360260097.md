@PHuenermund @Lester_Domes @RUBENSARO @jonasobleser @JohannesTextor @brandmaier @sweichwald @TheColeLab The question was not about path-specific effects (for which we have the  Avin etal result) but about the Total Effect, ie, E[Stroke|do(Age)]. The miracle of DAGs (not widely acknowledged) is that expressions of type E(Y|do(x), z)] do not need summation over paths.#Bookofwhy
