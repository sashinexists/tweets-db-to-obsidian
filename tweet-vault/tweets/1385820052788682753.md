Glad the JDA is re-labeled the "Van Leer Definition". I called it the "thoughtless 200". And to Michael Waltzer who begs for a "distance" between Zionophobia and anti-Semitism I say: Double the distance! Of course! the former is so much uglier in its heinous quest for legitimacy. https://t.co/EnW95BsYzs
