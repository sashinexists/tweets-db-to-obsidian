@_MiguelHernan @yudapearl Love your article on explanation vs prediction. Outstanding! Have you seen @ChristophMolnar Interpretable machine learning book? Wondering if this can work well in 'exploratory' agnostic causal analysis when one doesn't have a-priori causal models?  https://t.co/gVMre7GCZn
