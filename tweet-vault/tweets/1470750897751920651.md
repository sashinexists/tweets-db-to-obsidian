@smueller @stephensenn @yudapearl @ChristosArgyrop @soboleffspaces @AndrewPGrieve @PavlosMsaouel What information did the observational study provide?  Medical decision making requires expected efficacy information from the time of the decision point, not after a "wait a bit to see if the pt takes the drug" time point.
