@ProfLaurenRoss But, in my reading, section 4 on causal mechanical model does *not* apply to amygdala. The amygdala does not track fear without being coupled into the rest of the brain. It is not like the physical process, like a baseball, it is like a part of that baseball. https://t.co/caj1lP0UFW
