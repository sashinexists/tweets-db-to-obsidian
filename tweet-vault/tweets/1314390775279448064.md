@EvanCull @brentdg2 @elderofziyon "Political representation", even "statehood", was given many times, eg. 1947, before Beinart was born, and we remember what happened. So lets try an alternative, much less risky. Let one (just ONE) Palestinian leader utter the words "equally indigenous" and see what happens.
