@WvanAmsterdam @eliasbareinboim @GelovenNan @analisereal Limiting the word "effect" to binary contrasts is too constraining. Specifying the entire curve
 p(Y=y|X=x,do(A=a)) for all y,x,a is what "effect" means, especially in non linear, non-binary variables. With this understanding, I would label p(*) the x-specific effect of A on Y.
