@DJMinded @havivrettiggur This is not "anecdotal evidence" but a most informative and scientific evidence one can obtain for the assertion "vast majority". When you position dozens of sensitive sensors seeking a signal and no signal is detected, it's not anecdotal to conclude: "no signal was transmitted."
