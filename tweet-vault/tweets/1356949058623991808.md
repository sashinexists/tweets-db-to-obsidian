@tiagoandresvaz @EpiEllie @rkuchen Sure, we need statistics to lift us from finite samples to distributions, but we must lean on causal assumptions (ie DAGs) to lift us further, from association to intervention. The inference engine delineates what we can do w/o stat/data https://t.co/KBGKcmJxM8, and that's a lot.
