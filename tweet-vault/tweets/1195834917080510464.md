@yudapearl @RonKenett @stephensenn @learnfromerror I could not find the quote in volume I. 
Wikipedia quotes Vol. 2: 

"We strongly believe that design of experiment is a Bayesian experimentation process, ... one in which the experimenter approaches the experiment with some beliefs, to which he accommodates the design." (xxii)
