@VC31415 @yskout @PHuenermund The problem become sticky when we define a counterfactual Y_x  with x an event, not an equation.
If we have two equations:  Y=f(X) and Y=g(X), there is no unique equation to shut-of in order to define Y_x. SCM requires that there will be a unique equation for every variable.
