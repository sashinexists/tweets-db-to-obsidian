@PHuenermund @julianschuess @analisereal @nickchk @yudapearl Thank you, this is a brilliant clarification. If policymakers asked an analyst what the effect of 'schooling' is on scores, they'd want the bottom arrow in your graph. If we estimated for them the upper right arrow, we would be misleading them.
