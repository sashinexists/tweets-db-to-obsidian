@lewbel @yudapearl @causalinf @PHuenermund @econbookclub @Chris_Auld @analisereal @jdramirezc @PhilHaile Oh, and I am saying that in the expanded model “Q^S=Q^D“ is not an algebraic transformation of the full set of equations, it's not correct. In general, correct transformations yield structural equations, sometimes they are useful.
