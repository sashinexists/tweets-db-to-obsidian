@Navatso_IR @RashidaTlaib @RepAndyLevin You're right. I've assumed that other readers are as tuned as I am to the fine nuances in the conflict. To clarify, for Palestinians, "peaceful solution" is "no Israel". For Israelis, it is "Coexistence: two states for two peoples, equally legitimate and equally indigenous."
