I am surprised that 51% thinks RCT has anything to do with the DEFINITION of causal effect. Chapter 4 of #Bookofwhy labors to convince reader that it is just a means for "interrogating nature", that is, nature has the answer before the interrogation. Plenty of work for educators. https://t.co/DA4c8AIZaQ
