@ShireenQudosi @richard_landes I would like you to watch some of the consequences of Hadid family campaign to demonize Israel: https://t.co/LcRWXE2KrL.
They have millions of followers, and the mob is watching them, not you and me, saying: "It's open season! It's for the greater cause! Even Ilan Omar said so!"
