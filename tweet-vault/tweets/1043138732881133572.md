@CateyBunce @WiringTheBrain When done correctly, "meta analysis" was renamed  "data fusion", because we could not find any meta-analyst who could do it correctly, i.e., neutralize causal disparities, not seen in the data https://t.co/E1ap1N4ZCh I am curious if there are other ways of doing it correctly.
