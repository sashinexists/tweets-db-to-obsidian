@yudapearl @JohanDH2O @zacharylipton @tdietterich If your data set is low dimensional like [age, income] there may well be no significant distribution shift between 2 cities.
Working with 1k or 1M-dimensional data, it should be vanishingly rare to see a counterfactual shift without a distribution shift.
