@omaclaren @yudapearl No, M is one thing &amp; G another. Both appear in ID def &amp; are needed, but playing different roles. You miss the fundamental problem in CI when dismissing this distinction; "identification cond" has no meaning in this cntx. Also, check Def. 3.2.4 (3.2.3) in Causality (Pearl, 2000).
