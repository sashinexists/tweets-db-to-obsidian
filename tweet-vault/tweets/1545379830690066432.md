@IllyseusDasein @SamHarrisOrg @jordanbpeterson @BretWeinstein I do not understand what you are trying to insinuate, but I've known Joe Manson for 20 years. He ain't an oppressor, nor a "self-styled victim", nor any of the adjectives you associate with people you don't like. Please do not use this smear technique on this platform.
