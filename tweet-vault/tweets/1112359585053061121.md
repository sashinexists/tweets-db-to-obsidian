@Jabaluck @dlmillimet @snavarrol @yudapearl @a40ruhr @causalinf @PossebomVitor @nickchk Re stories: The problem is that it's too easy to come up with stories that sound somewhat plausible. And what then? Some resort to arguments by authority. But what we should actually be doing is accumulating evidence which stories (i.e. paths in a DAG) are valid and which aren't.
