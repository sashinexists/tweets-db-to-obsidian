@yudapearl @HarvardEcon Allow me to rephrase. Take an environment where endogeneity abounds and instruments are weak in general, like monetary policy studies (i.e. interest rates can’t be truly exogenous). It’s really hard to come up with a model that resembles reality w/o omitting something relevant.
