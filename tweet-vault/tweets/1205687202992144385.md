@charleendadams And my only unhappiness with Corbyn's defeat is that (according to analysts) he was not defeated for the reason he should have been: Racism, but for being wishy-washy on Brexit. Still, his defeat removes fears of shame &amp; darkness for all my colleagues in the UK - Congratulations!
