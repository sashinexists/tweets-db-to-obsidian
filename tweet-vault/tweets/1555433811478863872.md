@artistexyz @LeCun @GaryMarcus I agree that the NN-Symbols debate may not be the issue of interest, and that data-fitting vs model-based dichotomy can tell us more about the theoretical limitations of NN systems. For example, can NN's reject Simpson's drugs: good for men, good for women, bad for persons.
