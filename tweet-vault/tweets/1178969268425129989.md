@DrColinWPLewis @d_spiegel I love the quote "If the headline is interesting, it probably ain't true". @d_spiegel was also a pioneer in developing graphical models for expert systems (80's) so, if he says things are hard, he knows what he is saying, and he is ripe for joining the era of causation #Bookofwhy
