Glad to see our Tweet quoted in this article on the shaky foundations of Stanford's "Foundation Model" which, for me, is still a "what is it?" puzzle, not whether it's successful or not. The article also discusses what deserves the title "foundation," a topic I'd like to pursue. https://t.co/MD4toCA3Zu
