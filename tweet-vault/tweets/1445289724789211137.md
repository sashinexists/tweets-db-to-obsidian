1/3 @pablogerbas, this is indeed an important observation. The entire theory of do-calculus, hence of interventions &amp; causal effects, can be conducted at Rung-2, with no reference to unit-level counterfactuals. This is done (neatly) on p.23-4 of Causality https://t.co/PqATlrRh91 https://t.co/p1hxNcWVtd
