@ja_labrecque_ @PWGTennant @ProfMattFox @yudapearl @WhitneyEpi @ashley_naimi @mirschnitzer thx for including me in this discussion. iâ€™m learning a lot. i struggle bc 99.9% of research on obesity/wt gain in my field will be carried out &amp; interpreted the same way (probably even some of my own, TBH). policy will be made based on it. how can we make a sea change?
