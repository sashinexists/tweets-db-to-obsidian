@amitabhchandra2 @AdanZBecerra1 @yudapearl Economists tend to think hard to answer questions canâ€™t be answered until a natural experiment arises. This can cause economist to (a) ignore important questions and (b) self-assured hubris about their studies that are likely wrong (eg, Doleac and Mumherjee)
