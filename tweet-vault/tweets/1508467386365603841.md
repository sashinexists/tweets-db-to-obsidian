@RWJE_BA @noah_greifer @soboleffspaces @yudapearl @causalinf @EpiEllie @bveg3 I don’t think they are. Random confounding exists in RCT’s actually. I’m not sure how you can argue that generalization and lack of adherence is less of a problem compared to a less restrictive study population and more natural environment in comparison. https://t.co/vJOGGDQ3c1
