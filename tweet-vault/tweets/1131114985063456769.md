@theblub @twainus @yhazony @ylecun @GaryMarcus @tdietterich @rodneyabrooks @lexfridman @haldaume3 @StanfordHAI @albertwenger @Joi The way I speak may betray years of frustration to understand this literature. But if you examine my work your will see that I have never turned away a useful idea because of a mind  made up (at least I do not recall such mishap).  What's the idea I cannot afford to miss?
