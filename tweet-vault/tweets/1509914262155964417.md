This Tweet has an anecdotal continuation. Such conversation happened to me twice in public lectures and, after a long pin-drop silence, I said: "I'll tell you what, state it loud w/o meaning it, just move your lips, we won't quote you .." -- Pindrop silence, no lips moving, Nada. https://t.co/ZQ37lpF2q0
