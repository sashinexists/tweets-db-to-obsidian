@RWJE_BA @yudapearl @tom4everitt @nickinpractice @davidad @eliasbareinboim @victorveitch @RichardMCNgo @SmithaMilli @ryancareyai @gusl true one needs additional assumptions on top of the (nontrivial) rung 1 &amp; 2 assumptions. Doctors use simple mental models to make the same inferences (the patient would have survived if we had used a lower dose). Making these models explicit and formal seems safer to me
