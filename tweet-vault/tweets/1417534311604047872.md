Absolutely disgusting racism from the Asian studies department at @UCLA. I have never heard the term "yellow washing" before, but they have decided to pull out an old slur for East Asian people's for the sole purpose of condemning Israel. Thank you @yudapearl for speaking up! https://t.co/xDKnAAPVVC
