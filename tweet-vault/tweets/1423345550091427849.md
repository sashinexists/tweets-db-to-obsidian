@yudapearl @ProfMattFox I don't think I understand. Do you mean: we should represent them on a DAG, not w/a counterfactual expression for exchangeability b/c the DAG is easier for normal people to evaluate? ie, we should have written the blog referring to evaluating d-separ'n instead of exchangeability?
