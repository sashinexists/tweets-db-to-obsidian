@maximananyev @yudapearl @Susan_Athey @joshgans This example hardly supports Judea's point about the necessity of DAGs as AJR were well aware of the problem illustrated by the DAG (the reanalysis quantifies how measurement error can impact the bias). But agree DAGs can help clarify "bad control" issues.
