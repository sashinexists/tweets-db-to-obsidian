@yihanxu @yudapearl Yes, we have the time asymmetry (CP, T violation), we have causal and anti-causal Green functions, we have negative energy solutions going backwards in time, etc. We have the light-cone concept of the past.
Nevertheless, when physics is used in engineering context, it just works.
