@ConiByera @omaclaren @AndersHuitfeldt @yudapearl I think that for the way I am thinking of U, that is OK. If U is the door mechanism, then knowing the door is locked (Z = 0) doesn't change my knowledge of whether the doorknob is turned (X=1) unless I also know the state of the mechanism (U = X*Z). Perhaps I am misunderstanding?
