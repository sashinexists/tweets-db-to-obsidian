@yudapearl @f2harrell @smueller @ChristosArgyrop @soboleffspaces @AndrewPGrieve @PavlosMsaouel You made a very strong claim about women and men reacting differently to treatment. Such claims are not infrequently made. https://t.co/iJWto7IrXR
Nevertheless, they should be justified by data. I hope that you will provide primary references to your example.
