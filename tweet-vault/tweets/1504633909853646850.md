@Jon_Williamson_ @federicarusso @soboleffspaces @dylanarmbruste3 @causalinf SCMs accommodate systems with feedback, see Causality page 215-17 (don't miss footnote 10) and, in addition, provides algorithms for answering counterfactual questions in such systems, which is crucial for evidence pluralism.
