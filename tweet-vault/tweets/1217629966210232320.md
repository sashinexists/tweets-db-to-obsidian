@RUBENSARO @jonasobleser @yudapearl @PHuenermund @JohannesTextor @brandmaier @sweichwald @TheColeLab I think these sorts of simple additive-across/multiplicative-through convolutions of path effects are found in correlation analyses, but they can be quite far off in models where nonlinear response predominates. I'm sure Judea can point to cites where the general case is handled.
