@yudapearl @mendel_random @_MiguelHernan @statsepi IMO in the Book of Why discussion of  Lord’s paradox it is implicitly assumed that correlation is a simple one dimensional concept. However this only applies to “flat” datasets without hierarchy. Such is not the case here &amp; a Nelder analysis points the problem.
