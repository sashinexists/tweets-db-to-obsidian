@analisereal @autoregress @Jabaluck @eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @PACESconsulting @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @HeerJeet To rephrase, it is my impression that scholars in applied econ make statements about mediation (what they call "mechanisms") quite often and use procedures that are deemed intuitively appealing. The language of FD can improve the practice by shedding light on those intuitions.
