@edwardlandesber @ericcolson @yudapearl Yeah, seriously. I really think it's pretty amazing that d-separation is as simple as it isâ€”if you had told me to go figure out on my own how to reason about conditional independencies in a graph, definitely wouldn't have been obvious to me to expect such a crisp, *easy* answer.
