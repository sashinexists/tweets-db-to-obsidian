@DebraMessing @joncoopertweets Sorry Debra, #IsraeliApartheid is not that simple. Palestinians have been under attack for much longer than the "ðŸŽ  " carousel which is overly simplistic explanation for Arab - Israeli conflict. I speak as an Irish woman who knows of occupation by UK. It just isn't that simple
