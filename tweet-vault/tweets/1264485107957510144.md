@PHuenermund @beyers_louw What are "coefficients of the adjustment variables"? Are they structural coefficients on outgoing arrows or incoming arrows into those variables? Moreover, why not report them if identified? Moreover, why not teach stone-age readers which ones are, and which are not identified?
