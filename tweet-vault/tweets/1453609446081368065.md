@xenophilictb @DKedmey @EinatWilf Racist is he who replaces "equally legitimate" with "not even the size of a postage stamp" -- an ideology preached,  not by "some," but every teacher, cleric, author, or public figure, with no exception, backed by violent acts whenever possible. Recall, I've seen 1936, 1948, etc.
