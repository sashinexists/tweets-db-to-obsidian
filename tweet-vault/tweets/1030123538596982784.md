@yudapearl @l__ds @malco_barrett @NeuroStats @ken_rothman Well I’m not totally sure I understand equivalence, but I think you’re reading pies as set theory, &amp; assuming pie w/o B is same as one w/ B=0 (&amp;/or B=1?). But pies aren’t math sets, so you can’t add in B b/c that would imply B is *required* for the sufficient cause when it’s not.
