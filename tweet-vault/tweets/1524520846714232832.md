@TacoCohen @overlordayn @trunghlt I think it's feasible, but not easy, considering  that million years of evolution have not produced it in owls or even chimps. The key, I believe, rests in having an innate, domain-independent template that makes babies restless until they reach: "understanding", ie, domain-SCM.
