@jmwooldridge @steventberry I think you are still fighting the "silly SEM" period in the history of econ, to which PO contributed a wakeup call. But nowadays, when we start with "non-silly SEM" where autonomy is a defining feature, &amp;  from which POs emerge organically, if needed, do we need to mention them?
