@raymondshpeley @eliasbareinboim @autoregress @yudapearl @CarterPaddy I am asking for the smallest bite possible. Judea and Elias have theoretical results that I have read and understood. Their analytical framework is provably equivalent to one economists use more commonly. Each framework is more tractable for certain types of problems. (1/2)
