@omaclaren @djvanness @ConiByera @AndersHuitfeldt 2/ define what they mean by C. They can use mathematics, or examples, or the method of "penalty", which goes: "If I know C, I can escape from the penalty that I would suffer not knowing C." So far I have not seen a penalty definition of the concept sought by Dave. #Bookofwhy
