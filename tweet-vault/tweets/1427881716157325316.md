@seanjtaylor @MatheusFacure @CasualBrady 2/ from the SQ's that are estimated in non-CI tasks. The former includes: backdoor formula, IV estimands, DiD, front-door formula, transport formulas, etc. I dont know a book/paper that covers all SQ's that emerge from CI analyses; books usually cover some and not others.
