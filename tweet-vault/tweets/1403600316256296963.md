@ThomSeaton @RabbiWolpe @nytimes @CNN @NewsHour @SethAMandel @DrMichaelOren @bariweiss I am so glad I was able to resist Linda's charms and call her "fake feminist" https://t.co/2nCKQxaZHX.
Fake as she was, I still respected her more principled adherence to her heritage and identity than the spineless 100 Jewish "leaders" who came to her defense.
