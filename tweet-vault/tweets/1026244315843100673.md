You can see in the table that everyone has 3 potential salaries (outcomes) but only 1 potential salary is actually observed for each person. 

Rubin views the table as a missing data problem â€” which is good for statisticians b/c they have lots of tools for imputing missing data! https://t.co/ayglJZF4BY
