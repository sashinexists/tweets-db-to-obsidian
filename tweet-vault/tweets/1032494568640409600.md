@swanderingf Great question! The answer is YES,  under selection. Examine the graph:
X----&gt;Z&lt;---U---&gt;Y.   If we select patients having Z=1 (say pain from treatment X)
then the path between X and Y will be active, producing correlation w/o causation ie confounding. #Bookofwhy #causalinference
