Here is a reminder that in 1909 - Jews in the Ottoman Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem (no you clowns there was no 'Palestine') stood upon an empty coastal strip and dreamed of building a city there.

Today this sandy dune is Tel Aviv - a regional economic and technological powerhouse. https://t.co/f2gKaTApWS
