@yudapearl @yskout @PHuenermund It is a construct. It is fairly common in applied econometrics (sometimes equations are replaced not by “X=x” but by other stochastic equations). For example, change competitive walras equilibrium to monopoly or vice versa;  Change women’s wage schedule to men’s schedule; etc.
