@yudapearl @ewerlopes I attended a great course in causality in 2018 at ETH Zurich (given by Prof. Meinshausen). The course is offered each year and they have a script and slides online. Can be found here: https://t.co/20ah8tVqyS 
Maybe this is useful for you (if you don't know about this already).
