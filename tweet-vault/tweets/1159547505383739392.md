@fuzzydunlop123 @steventberry @yudapearl @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @MariaGlymour @autoregress Okay, but Northwestern, Chicago, Minnesota, etc... seem to have similar cultures. It clearly varies by dept., my point is that your experience and my experience at a handful may not be representative. Do you know of broader survey evidence?
