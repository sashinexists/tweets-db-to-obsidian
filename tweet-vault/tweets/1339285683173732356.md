We built a simple model for spatio-temporal QA from videos on CLEVRER and and CATER datasets, exploiting a soft 'object' estimation (MONet), self-attention and self-supervised (BERT-style) learning.

It equals the (SOTA) perf of neuro-symbolic models with 40% less labelled data https://t.co/u2AvqWp1yk
