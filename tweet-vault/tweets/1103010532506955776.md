@omaclaren @analisereal @BreskinEpi Yeah this is interesting. I think it depends on our definition of well-defined/posed - as you said there are lots of statistical parameters that we can't estimate well at all (eg regression fns w/no assumptions), &amp; causal params when translated to stats params are no different.
