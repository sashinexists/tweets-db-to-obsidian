When we have a causal diagram we can create our equations. Pearl considers DAG 2üëáüèΩ, since DAG 1 is pretty simple (matching or stratifying will work).

For SCM, we construct 2 functions: S_{ed}=f_{ed}(EX, ED, U_s) and
EX = f_{ed}(ED,U_ex)

U_s &amp; U_ex are other causes of S and EX https://t.co/IgHmnOKRU7
