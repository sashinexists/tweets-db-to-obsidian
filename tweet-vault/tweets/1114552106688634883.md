@HannesMalmberg1 @autoregress @eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @juli_schuess @CarterPaddy I should clarify the 1st remark--structural papers could use DAGs to represent a part of their model, and I think this may be one of the most important use-cases as structural economists tend to be less familiar with the "t-DAGs" that drive reduced form work.
