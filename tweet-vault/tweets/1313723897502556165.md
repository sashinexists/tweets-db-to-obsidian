Another winner of the 2020 Nobel is Roger Penrose who is remembered in AI circles by his 1989 book "The Emperor's New Mind", arguing for the impossibility of strong AI.
I wonder if he changed his mind in light of new advances in AI, especially deep learning and causal reasoning? https://t.co/bcbTrjjtQV
