@malco_barrett @EpiEllie @l__ds @NeuroStats @ken_rothman Back to PIEs. The fact that so many smart people are in love with PIEs gives me 99% assurance that there is something good there. The fact that none was able to explain how to look at a bunch of pies and get the insight they swear by tells me that someone should do it. #Bookofwhy
