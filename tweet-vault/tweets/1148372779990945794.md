@yudapearl @Jabaluck @MariaGlymour @PHuenermund @EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer But Jason &amp; I are saying something different: tho reality is complex, good design/institutional knowledge can obviate the need to specify (perhaps incorrectly) such complexity. And tho it's not a silver bullet, econ has learned a lot by searching for such "quasi-experiments" 2/3
