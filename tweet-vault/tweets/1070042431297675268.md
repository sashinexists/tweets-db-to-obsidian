@zshahn @EpiEllie @yudapearl @_MiguelHernan In @yudapearl's CISP book, section 4.1 he says E[Y | do(X=1)] = E[Y_{X=1}].  Counterfactual (level 3) notation can represent everything in interventions (level 2), but level 2 can't represent level 3 (e.g. E[Y_{X=1} | X=0] can't be represented in do-notation.
