@Jabaluck @juli_schuess @PHuenermund @yudapearl @fuzzydunlop123 @autoregress @MariaGlymour @EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer @metrics52 I have the impression that you're moving on too fast from this paper. This is a conditional IV, which means that there is an observational study "hidden" inside. Are you convinced by this obs. study? Why? Do they account for the *sources of variation* of the confounding path?
