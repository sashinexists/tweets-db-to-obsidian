@yudapearl @seanjtaylor Appreciate you clarifying your intent. People (often junior women) use qualifiers like “IMO” to be polite. So it felt like you were kind of nitpicking my language to say that I had poor intellectual rigor when I was just being chatty. Will try to read w more generosity in future
