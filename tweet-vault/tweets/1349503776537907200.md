Happy to have our paper with Paul  and Hiro appear in JoE.  Back in May we found that masks, lockdown policies contributed to mitigating Covid-19 (contrary to  popular views that mitigation happened all due to private response) Policies also matter, and DAGs were super-helpful.ðŸ˜€ https://t.co/fP1FS35TZA
