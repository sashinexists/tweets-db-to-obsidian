@autoregress @yudapearl @causalinf Peter, this is not about taste.The point here is that, given a set of counterfactual statements, there's no procedure to derive its testable implications, except "by hand". If, however, you encode these assumptions in a DAG, we can immediatley derive them using d-separation.
