@VC31415 @PHuenermund @paulgp I would be grateful even for a semi-precise definition or just clarifying which "choice of method" IS NOT "research design". Reading through the "credibility revolution" literature I've noticed that replacing every "design" with "my favorite method" makes things perfectly clear.
