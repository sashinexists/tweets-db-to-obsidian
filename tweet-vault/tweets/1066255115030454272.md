@CsabaSzepesvari @eliasbareinboim @jasonhartford @dustinvtran @zacharylipton @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @ShalitUri Are you protesting the notion that RL has limits? or perhaps that RL (as practiced) is different from CI? or from AI?.. I am willing to declare CI a tiny subset of RL, if this would entice 5% of RL researchers to adopt 5% of the tools developed in CI, eg., https://t.co/rXgGXv58LL
