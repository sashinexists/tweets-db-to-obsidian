@tdietterich @StanfordHAI It is not probabilistic models that are needed for fusing data from multiple sources, but CAUSAL models. The question of whether we have them and how to use them will only be answered when 50% PhD's in ML will grasp  the Ladder of Causation &amp; its fundamental constraints.
