@dustinvtran @zacharylipton @CsabaSzepesvari @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @yudapearl @ShalitUri To be clear, I don't think calling bandits as 'causal inference' (CI), generically. is helpful. I call CI if it uses a causal model, the language &amp;  tools of modern CI. Otherwise, everything will be called CI &amp; the label will have no meaning. Causal MDPs: https://t.co/oiOIPvZIt9
