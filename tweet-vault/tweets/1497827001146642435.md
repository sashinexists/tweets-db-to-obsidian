@GeraldNGOM @AnneHerzberg14 @StandWithUs @drdivine @MiriamElman @ARomirowsky True, but I would rather think of remedial actions. The reason I mentioned @Conf_of_Pres is that every Jewish Federation has a "community fund" that advises innocent donors where their wishes can best be realized. If we educate this fund, chances are even EDI gates will open.
