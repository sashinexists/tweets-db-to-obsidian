@instrumenthull @pietrobiroli @PHuenermund @paulgp @dlmillimet @yudapearl @eliasbareinboim @josh_t_dean @uhlily Let me rephrase. I think the more you can change X while leaving all else constant, the easier is to think about causality. You can certainly change neighborhoods (with housing vouchers) and leave all else constant (at the very least, leave pre-voucher history constant)
