@yudapearl @eliasbareinboim @jasonhartford @dustinvtran @zacharylipton @CsabaSzepesvari @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @ShalitUri Training an agent on an env that requires it to consider interventions it hasn't performed before will tease out the counterfactual reasoning capability which you seek. To me, the question is "what should this environment look like?", not "how should we structure the model?"
