@yudapearl @causalinf @nickchk Of course, i mean directional connections
▫️d-separation is a graph’s property whether edges are causal or associational
▫️DAG has a topological ordering of nodes
▫️ordering and Markov assumption determine the factorization
▫️ factorization and d-separation give identifiability
