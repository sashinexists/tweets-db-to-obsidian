@soboleffspaces @mygoodjeans @nltmcd Here you are doing the counterfactual thinking in your head, based on what we know about Archimedes. But formally, the sentence 
"If L then M" does not imply "L = false".
Moreover, even "If L then M" &amp; "L=false" together, do not imply "M=false".
e.g, the earth could move by magic
