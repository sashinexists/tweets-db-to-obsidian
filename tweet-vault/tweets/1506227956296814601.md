@dad_zibao @leads_connect @_reactdev @CatherineAdenle You ask "Where is the #SCM?" I'm afraid ML folks wouldn't know what you are talking about. It's not in their education, nor training, and when you remind them that you can't make decisions w/o causation, they answer: No problem, its just "inductive bias".  https://t.co/dxqdoqMsQm
