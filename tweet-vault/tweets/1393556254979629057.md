@JaapAbbring @pedrohcgs NBER Working Papers Series shapes much of what econometrics students read or take as "worth knowing." ET published my paper ONLY because I presented it at the 2011 Haavelmo Centennial in Oslo but, when I asked NBER to post it, they said: No, you are not part of "the family".
