@eliasbareinboim @zacharylipton @CsabaSzepesvari @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @yudapearl @ShalitUri Those are great references. Bandits, recommender systems, and experimental design have definitely seen a lot of success with causal inference. Do you know of any with a state space or episode with &gt;1 time step, which is typical in RL?
