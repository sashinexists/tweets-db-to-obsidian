@yudapearl @NeuroStats @l__ds @ken_rothman @EpiEllie I haven't thought through what that implies for working with a SCM in the usual way, but one interesting thing they note is that, because SCs are deterministic, stratifying by D = 0 must also block at those nodes. I feel like I've got a nibble. What do you think? (3/3) https://t.co/Z6yq0PnTqJ
