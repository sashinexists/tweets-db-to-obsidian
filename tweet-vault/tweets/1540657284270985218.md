Confused as to why I strongly oppose the mapping project? It literally targets Jewish teen and youth organizations. Few things are more dangerous and abhorrent and would not be tolerated in if applied to other faiths. We should all fear a massacre of Jewish youth as a result. https://t.co/DFlDxkvtCt
