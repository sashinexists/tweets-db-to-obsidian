@yudapearl @CsabaSzepesvari @eliasbareinboim @mendel_random Isn't the ignorability assumption equivalent to assuming that the DAG belongs to a particular class? Then this assumption is easy to challenge by specifying a DAG for the system that lives outside of this class.

This is the entire subfield of sensitivity analysis. Hardly hidden.
