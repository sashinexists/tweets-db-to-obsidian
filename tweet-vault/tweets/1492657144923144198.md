@yudapearl @gottfriedmath @BayesianNet @profnfenton By the way,this method could be used to find probability distributions for PNS, PN, PS, not just bounds.And then, one could choose the maximum of those probability distributions as point estimates. One could also generalize JudeasRx to dynamic bnets,to give time dependence of PNS
