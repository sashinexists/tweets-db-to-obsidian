@malco_barrett @NeuroStats @l__ds @ken_rothman @EpiEllie Great. But since every potential outcome model is a derivative of a SCM (structural causal model) we can ask: What connects SSC and SCM? To see this, lets ponder (1) What this pie means to you? (2) What the pie would look like when Y=1 if and only if A=B. #Epibookclub. #Bookofwhy
