I was waiting for this answer "the role of blood pressure in the causal question". It is the kind of answer @EpiEllie could not give, because it violates the dictates of RCT imitation. BP has no well-defined "role", only interventions have "roles". See  https://t.co/z89XWA0OdR https://t.co/mi12nQrYc0
