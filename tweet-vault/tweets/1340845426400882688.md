@VC31415 @Chris_Auld @DonskerClass @lewbel @PhilHaile @steventberry For the life of me, it's 100 yrs after SEM were introduced to economics and economists are still arguing about their interpretation. Doesn't this mean that instead of asking what another economist wrote or thought we should start asking what he SHOULD have written or thought?
