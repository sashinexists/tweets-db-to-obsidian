@fhuszar @eliasbareinboim @CsabaSzepesvari It is not drawing or not drawing the model that counts but whether you correctly interpret the assumptions in the model and what you do with them. I am waiting for Csaba to clarify whether his graph represents the engineer or mother nature. Each leads to a different conclusion.
