@yudapearl @VC31415 @PHuenermund @paulgp Yes.  The rebranding of old-fashioned consideration of identification (or at least an intuitive version thereof) with "research design" label is great to the extent that it makes people be more careful.  But hard to see new substance, much less a revolution.
