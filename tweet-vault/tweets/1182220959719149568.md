@omaclaren @Prof_Livengood Well put. If we "allow probabilities over whatever", like many Bayesians, then everything is "probabilistic", even Astrology, just assign Pr. to "unicorns have blue eyes" and other conclusions you desire to derive. Same as spraying priors on parameters (of priors...) #Bookofwhy.
