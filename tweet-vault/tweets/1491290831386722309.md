@robberg15 @isaacdecastrog I would try the @ADL. In the old days, they used to send someone to speak with the principal and make sure the person responsible gets reprimanded, on record. But that was when the offense was against Jews, not sure where Israelis rank on  #ADL priorities these days. I would try.
