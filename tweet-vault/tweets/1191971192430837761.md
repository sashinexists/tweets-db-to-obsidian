@yudapearl @stephensenn I followed up on this. BH2 interpret confounding as "confusing" p.338, The Book of Why as "mixing", p.138. In Causality you provide a causal definition on non-confounding (Def 6.2.1). Since they are apparent differences, better keep a qualifier of causal definition of confounding
