@MeganTStevenson @PHuenermund @paulgp @dlmillimet @pietrobiroli @yudapearl @eliasbareinboim That's what I mean, yes. So at least insofar as we are interested in "discrimination" on self-reported race, it seems clear in the algorithmic case we can distinguish between direct discrimination and indirect discrimination (I.e. "unfairness" in a "race blind" algorithm)
