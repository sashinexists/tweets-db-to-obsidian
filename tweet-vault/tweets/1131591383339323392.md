1/1 This is amazing!! Thanks for finding it. I can't believe that econometric students would sit through this class and not laugh  how hard the instructors sweat to avoid commonsense. I Imagine one of these students meeting an epi friend in the library, or reading #Bookofwhy . https://t.co/b87ykjmkWr
