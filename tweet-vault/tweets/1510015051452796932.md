@RWJE_BA @soboleffspaces @dylanarmbruste3 @yudapearl @nickchk @Lizstuartdc @PWGTennant Causality cannot be inferred from OBSERVATIONAL data alone. Of course if you run interventions (RCTs) and collect their results as ‘data’ then you will be able to evidence causal direction from this kind of data. Same if your data contains explicit causal info, e.g. timing info.
