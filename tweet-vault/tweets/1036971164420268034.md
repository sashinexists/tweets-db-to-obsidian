@PHuenermund @yudapearl @eliasbareinboim Right, I read this before and it nicely explains what causal graphs can do: Visualise relationships and give simple rules how to run your regressions. I still don't get what's wrong with the potential outcomes though. Seems to me they are complementary concepts, not substitutes.
