@alexdamour @dustinvtran @eliasbareinboim @jasonhartford @zacharylipton @CsabaSzepesvari @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @ShalitUri I checked Google recruitment ad - no "causal inference" mentioned. UCLA graduates 1/3 PhD per year in CI. Who will shape future education in this country if they go work for Google? AI counts on the smart scientists at Google to foresee where the next revolution is heading
