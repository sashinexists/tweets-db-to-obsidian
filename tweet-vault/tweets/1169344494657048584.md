@Jabaluck @yudapearl @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal Yes, but these thousand potential "correlates" exist no matter from which side you approach the problem. And I actually think we'll be able to do just fine with much smaller models. After all, our theory models also don't contain thousands of variables. https://t.co/oWLMoAuLjh
