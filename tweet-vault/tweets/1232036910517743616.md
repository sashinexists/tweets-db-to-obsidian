@jim_savage_ @steventberry @Jabaluck @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @MariaGlymour @autoregress Thanks for re-posting. The word "counterfactual" appears dozens of times in these slides. Perhaps they can clarify how traditional econ defined Y_x(u) or, even more ambitiously, which of "structural vs. reduced" form is more convenient for evaluating E[Y_x|X=x', Y=y']? #Bookofwhy
