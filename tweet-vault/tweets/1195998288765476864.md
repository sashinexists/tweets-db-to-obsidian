@yudapearl @stephensenn @learnfromerror Judea - what you simply ask(ed) is how to design experiments. This is one of the important areas of statistics. The study design is determined BEFORE you see any responses. Optimising your budget in the X space, with its constraints, is all about that. RL is related to this.
