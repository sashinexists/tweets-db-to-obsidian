@dchackethal @ks445599 @SamHarrisOrg @yudapearl Very persuasive … not.

My critique of Popper/Deutsch is not that their ideas of knowledge is wrong, it’s much better than most alternatives, but that it’s a view from a human perspective and not very operational.

For example, what exactly is critique? How does it operate?
