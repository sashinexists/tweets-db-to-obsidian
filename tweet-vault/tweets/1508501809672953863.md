@soboleffspaces @dylanarmbruste3 @yudapearl @noah_greifer @causalinf @EpiEllie @bveg3 This is another stupid (and unethical) idea sorry. Of course is a problem in medicine compute the treatment effect with assumptions. Is what we don't want in evidence! There are many examples where this "assumptions from the experts" are domonstrated complitly wrong in a RCT.
