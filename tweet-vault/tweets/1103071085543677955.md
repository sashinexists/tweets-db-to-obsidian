@yudapearl @edwardhkennedy @analisereal @BreskinEpi Suppose I have a causal model which is a 1-1 map of my underlying casual parameters to the observable pop distribution. Hence identifiable. Suppose also the causal parameters live in an infinite dimensional space and the map is compact. Is estimation possible?
