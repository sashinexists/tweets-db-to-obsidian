@maier_ak @hardmaru @ngutten @jsusskin @LeCun @thomaskipf When we talk "algorithms" everything seems to be doable in DL or NN etc. But when we talk about "information" the limitations become clear -- information cannot be created by processing data, it is either there or not. As Cartwright said: "No causes in, no causes out." #Bookofwhy
