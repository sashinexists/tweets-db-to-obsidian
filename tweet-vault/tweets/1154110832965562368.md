@Jabaluck @yudapearl @fuzzydunlop123 I think we're talking past each other, because I've explicitly talked about that DAGs help us getting past identification strategies, templates, t-DAGs or whatever. And they work both for internal (confounding, selection) as well as external validity (transportability).
