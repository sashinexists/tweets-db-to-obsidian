@jmwooldridge @steventberry The 1980-90 regressional invasion of economentrics (See Causality, 2000) was traumatic, agree, and led to the PO rebellion and overswing. But the recovery has been traumatic too, and dogmatic, purging SEM &amp; First Law from econ literature. Now people are asking for "the bridge".
