@VC31415 @causalinf @lewbel @PHuenermund Reading the main text, I'm trying to share your enthusiasm but can't understand the research question: "how much attribution would node 1 have received if edge (1, 2) had not propagated the change at node 1?" This sounds like "path-specific effect", isn't it trivial to compute?
