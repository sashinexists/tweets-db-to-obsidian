This makes me admire the Hebrew Bible. King David is arguably the most admired of all its ancient heroes and, yet, the authors do not attempt to whitewash any of his weaknesses, including murders and moral atrocities that transcend time-sensitive norms. Time for every season. https://t.co/XQHxBnfb0i
