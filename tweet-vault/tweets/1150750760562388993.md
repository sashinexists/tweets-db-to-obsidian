@oliverbeige @VladZamfir @timelessdev @cryptoecongames 2/ When I coined the name "Bayesian networks" (1985), but I am camp-friendly and would not mind switching if you can tell me what I am switching to. In the meantime I also wrote "Why I am only half Bayesian"  https://t.co/gqeQb23En9 which will affect my next camp #Bookofwhy
