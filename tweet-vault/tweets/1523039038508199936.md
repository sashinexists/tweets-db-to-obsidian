"We have to listen to Nature"- beautifully put! But if Natures speaks Swahili and we barely speak English, how can we listen to Nature? The Nature I know speaks cause-effect, the statisticians of 1990's (including Box) spoke probability. How did they expect to listen? Now we can. https://t.co/WM8OZSe9ss
