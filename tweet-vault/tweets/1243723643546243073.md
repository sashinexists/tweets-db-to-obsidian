@analisereal @omaclaren I would add that structural models are causal entities and should be annotated by arrows Y&lt;--f(X,e), not equality signs. Once the distinction is made explicitly, I embrace the paper as "relevant", else, "suspect of generating confusion" as in  https://t.co/CEpVusa5eB #Bookofwhy
