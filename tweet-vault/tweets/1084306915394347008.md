@eliasbareinboim @statwonk @yudapearl @PHuenermund We can - and usually do - build BHMs completely independently of any data. They are based on generative mechanism, not empirical fitting to observed data. Again the interesting question seems to be what if I don’t know some of the model but can make some qualitative assumptions?
