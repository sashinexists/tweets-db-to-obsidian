@intensivemargin @CarterPaddy @mkessler_DC @t0nyyates I don't have a ready copy of "Mostly Harmless Econometrics", but I am nevertheless willing to bet that the authors cannot answer the question: "Given a general economic model, can parameter ALPHA  be estimated by OLS?" How come? Because it is super-human to answer it w/o graphs.
