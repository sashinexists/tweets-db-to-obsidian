May your son's memory always be blessed @yudapearl! Daniel's last words &amp; pride in his Jewishness, led me to ask about the importance of my own Judaism &amp; role of Israel. Today, having made Aliyah, I am a proud citizen of the State of Israel and I owe that to your courageous son! https://t.co/awYQ9VMS8c
