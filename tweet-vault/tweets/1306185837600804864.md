@julianschuess @analisereal @m_clem @nickchk @yudapearl Isn't autonomy a problem here? It's not possible to independently vary "6th grade" without also affecting "5th grade" (assuming you face a pupil who just finished 4th grade and skipping grades isn't possible). Taking years of schooling as count variable circumvents this problem.
