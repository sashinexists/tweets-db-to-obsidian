The primary attraction of probabilities over causality was "trust what you see, not what you think". This was later amplified by "trust what you can express and analyze, not what you can't". Pearson, Reichenbach and Suppes, were lured by the latter. Both work on ML folks today. https://t.co/sEX6xKvKk8
