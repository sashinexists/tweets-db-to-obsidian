@nberpubs, Can one comment on the recent NBER posting of Heckman and Pinto? or are comments restricted to "members of the NBER family only,"  thus isolating NBER readers from the rest of the world?
Any NBER member among our 60K readers willing to help me pass through this wall? https://t.co/PflK71lfZY
