@wealdengirl @deborahlipstadt @IzaTabaro Debra is right in NOT equating the two. By saying: "anti-Zionism IS ANTISEMITISM" one implies that the latter is more despicable than the former and, indirectly, bestows some leniency onto an eliminationist ideology, which is more dangerous than its emotional rival.
