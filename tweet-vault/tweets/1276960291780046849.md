@19Naranjito82 I cannot buy the "there is no right and wrong" argument, unless it comes from someone who tries the X-&gt;Y-&gt;Z example in https://t.co/JO9ksVhUXL and concludes: "no right and wrong". I have not met such a person yet. Economists avoid toy examples because they show the right &amp; wrong.
