@yudapearl @causalinf @PHuenermund @lewbel @Susan_Athey @pedrohcgs @snavarrol @TymonSloczynski @tdetonberry @MacroPru I don't understand your point. Don't you agree that there are many different causal models we could write down under which an OLS regression controlling for a set of observables nonetheless estimates the causal effect?
