@EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer @MariaGlymour @autoregress And @EpiEllie, of course if you picked a random IV, confounders would be equally a concern as with "X". But the whole point of finding a quasi-experiment is to locate some portion of the variation in X that is well-understood so confounders can be credibly assessed.
