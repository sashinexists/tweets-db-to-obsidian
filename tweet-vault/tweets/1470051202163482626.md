@guyharvey70 @stephensenn @yudapearl @soboleffspaces @AndrewPGrieve @f2harrell You can simply focus on the ARR=17% and use thought experiments to clarify that metric to patients. Does that ARR correspond to a specific time-point BTW? This is another common confusion that NNTs often cause to clinicians and patients.
