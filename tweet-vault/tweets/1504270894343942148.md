@HL327 @stephensenn @soboleffspaces @JFronczekMD @EpiEllie @f2harrell @ADAlthousePhD @artistexyz @statsepi @GuyattGH @GRADE_WG The explanation you provide for the findings in the example are plausible. Our point is that the conclusion holds regardless of the explanation. Moreover, I would not attribute the surprising data to the RCT, which is assumed ideal. The culprit is whimsical free-choice behavior.
