I believe it was Erekat who was conflating cultural and genetic continuity - I made the distinction crystal clear. While there may be some trace of Canaanite genes in
Erekat's DNA (I doubt it) there is ZERO cultural continuity here -- the only thing that counts for a "narrative". https://t.co/twHP06Qe11
