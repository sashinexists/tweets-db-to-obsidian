@MeganTStevenson @PHuenermund @paulgp @dlmillimet @pietrobiroli @yudapearl @eliasbareinboim @josh_t_dean @uhlily It does, and thank you again for taking the time both today and yesterday to explain and engage. I think we agree much more than we disagree, and I've learned a lot from it. I'll definitely re-read Lily's paper and the others from this epic thread!
