@austinvhuang @holdmytowel @erichorvitz @Susan_Athey @MSFTResearch Replace "given the graph" with "given a world" and you are in standard scientific method, going from theories to evidence, then backward, to refuting theories when evidence so dictates. Take away the former, gone is the latter. Take away the graph, and you lost touch w/ reality.
