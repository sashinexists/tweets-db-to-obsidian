@ConiByera @LucyStats @AlexaYakubovich @AnjaLeist @rohitpojha @EpiEllie @AbbyCScience @Lester_Domes @_MiguelHernan @casualinfer What I called "causal effect" (in Causality 2000) was the entire sequence: Y(X=x) x=1, 2, 3, ... or E[Y(X=x)] x=1,2,3, .... From which you can form differences eg E[Y(X=5)]-E[Y(X=3)] or play with ratios, eg E[Y(X=2)]/E[Y(X=1)], or follow your fancy. #Bookofwhy
