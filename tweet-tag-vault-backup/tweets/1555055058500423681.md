@artistexyz @yudapearl Big difference btwn "random sampling" (="2 subsets *chosen* at random") and "randomizn" (=experimentation).RCTs (experiments) don't "choose" subjects at random-they *enroll* subjects who *happen* to 1) present for care; and 2) be eligible for randomizn.https://t.co/Jri9Bdngl4
