@stephensenn @NP_Jewell Disagree. The Book of Why analysis of design 1 is right.  There is no "block structure" in the story, and no one is "designing" any experiment here. It is a natural process involving 3-variables that IMO need not be complicated with alien notions taken from design of experiments.
