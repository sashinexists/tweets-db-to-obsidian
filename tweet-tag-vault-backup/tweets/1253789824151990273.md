@autoregress @PACESconsulting @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @Jabaluck @HeerJeet What is CMAR? Is it Missing Completely at Random MCAR, as used here https://t.co/iARsP3dPRf? If so, my answer is probably YES. Most non-parametric problems in economics now have solutions. But it was undersold. Eco. was not fortunate to have a leader saying: Look guys, Its Great!
