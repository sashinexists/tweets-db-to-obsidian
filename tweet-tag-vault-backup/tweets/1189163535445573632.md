@EpidByDesign @LauraBBalzer @eliasbareinboim @Megtron9 @Lizstuartdc @leskocar @_MiguelHernan @Carthica @herbps10 @LeontineAlkema @BreskinEpi @nondogmatist @edwardsjk Your abstract says: "we show that even perfect internal validity does not ensure that a causal effect will be unbiased in a specific target population."
