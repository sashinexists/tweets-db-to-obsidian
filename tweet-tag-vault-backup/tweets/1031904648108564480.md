@PWGTennant @ProfMattFox @yudapearl @WhitneyEpi @ashley_naimi @mirschnitzer @lisabodnar But my 2 cents is that let's recognize that such variables, while good for measurement purposes, are not as good for causal inference purposes. Where possible, let's try to estimate the causal effects of variables that we want to or know how to intervene on.
