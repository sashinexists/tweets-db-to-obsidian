@anndvision @noah_greifer @soboleffspaces @causalinf @EpiEllie @bveg3 @Lizstuartdc I would never say is is not reasonable to ask a question about a human being. But I would like to exhaust first the possibilities latent in non-chaotic systems and, then, if proven hopeless, explore chaotic directions. So far, I've been mighty encouraged by those possibilities.
