I just read Maudlin review. It's largely sensible, save for two mistakes: (1) ".. it is not possible to think causally but not counterfactually." Causal Bayesian Networks demonstrate that it is possible. (2) I was intimately familiar with the Tetrad project of the 1980's. Mute! https://t.co/g77X2NRtlH
