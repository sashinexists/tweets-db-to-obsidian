@ingorohlfing @causalinf @HenningStrandin @soboleffspaces @EpiEllie @nickchk This is where I've found Woodward unclear; is it "how distributions change" or "how variables change"? The former is insufficient for defining counterfactuals, see  https://t.co/PqATlrRh91 Section 1.4.4 Fig. 1.6. Knowing how dist. change does not tell us how variables change.
