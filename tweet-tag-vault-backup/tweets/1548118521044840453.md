@jeffreywatumull @DavidDeutschOxf My first reaction: Bacon, Hume and Popper tried to capture the way science works, this paper tries to capture the way machine learning works. I do not see the connection given how far machine learning is from emulating scientific thinking. (e.g., counterfactual thinking)
