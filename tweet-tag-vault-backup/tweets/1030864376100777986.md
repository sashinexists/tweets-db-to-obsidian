Hypothesis generation is pretty simple: (1) mine⛏the heck out of big data to find associations and then (2) use causal thinking &amp; modeling to evaluate whether those associations are causal or not. 

Arguably, a lot of science does this but maybe not enough of part 2😬🤦🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/a9EqjkqzyC
