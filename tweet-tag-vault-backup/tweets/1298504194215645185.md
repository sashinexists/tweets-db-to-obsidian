@offaltube @VinuSelvaratnam @MakingSenseHQ It's hard to imagine how a person could find regression to be simpler that causal BN. Unless of course that person got indoctrinated by Stat-101, which makes it hard to come back and think intuitively -- cause and effect. Five-ten years from now, Stat-101 will start with CBN.
