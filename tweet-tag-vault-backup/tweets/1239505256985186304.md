@rodakker @tudorcodes @imleslahdin I hope what I mean by "causal" coincides with yours, causality is a human language. As to Jaynes, he was sold on probabilities, so I do not believe he can define "causal arrows" better than other Bayesians, who are semi-alien to causation:  https://t.co/gqeQb23En9 #Bookofwhy
