@earnmyturns @zacharylipton @yudapearl Double standard here: nobody complained about the clarity of symbol-manipulation when Hinton, Bengio, &amp; LeCun argued against it in Nature 2015 (or when Rumelhart and McClelland did earlier in 1986). Or on a daily basis when they program with operations over variables!
