@eliasbareinboim @analisereal @yudapearl @maya_sen Right. Maybe a valuable way of thinking about this is that we can understand effects of non-manipulable causes, provided we can define the cause. But we can also have natural language to label some phenomena for which effects cannot be defined because the cause is poorly defined.
