This is as solid an argument as I have seen, and can easily verified by simulation. There remains only to explain why Z does not hurt us. After all, Z is a driver of M, so it constrains the variation of M, especially when their correlation is high, almost like conditioning on M. https://t.co/bSZyyciAEe
