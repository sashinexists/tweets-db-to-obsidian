@lihua_lei_stat @VC31415 @yudapearl @artistexyz @ShalitUri @CasualBrady ah, right, I lost track of the fact that this thread is about DAGs! 
Then another trivial example is (T-&gt;Y, X-&gt;T) with the backdoor functional and E[Y|T=1]-E[Y|T=0] identifying the ATE, the latter even when positivity doesn't hold.
