@pietrobiroli @instrumenthull @MeganTStevenson @PHuenermund @paulgp @dlmillimet @eliasbareinboim @josh_t_dean @uhlily Surely we can talk about the effect of sex on "observer-1 perception of Sex" which, in turns, affects "observer-1 expectations" etc. Also, we can talk about the effect of sex on the secretion of certain hormones at a certain age.
