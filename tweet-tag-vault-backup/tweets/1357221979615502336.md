An organization that can't decide if Israel should live (2-states) or die (1-state) can't pose as a human right entity because, by my latest count, there are 8 million human beings on the Israeli side, the great majority of whom recall one's right to life &amp; self determination. https://t.co/hWz1hI7yOC
