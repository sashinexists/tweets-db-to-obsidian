I'm not surprised to see Rep @Ilhan blaming Israel for every pain &amp; suffering in the world. She was brought up in Mogadishu where (acc. to compatriots) it's the Jews fault when the water stops running. I'm surprised at her 1.2M Twitter followers who keep drinking from her well. https://t.co/7cUZkpPhj0
