@AnneHerzberg14 @richard_landes @stan_state It is not funding that the faculty of @stan_state should worry about, but their reputation. As much as I am telling myself "dont blame the grass for one bad weed", it does reflect on their mentality, what they tolerate as "scholarship" and what they feed students. STANISLAUS
