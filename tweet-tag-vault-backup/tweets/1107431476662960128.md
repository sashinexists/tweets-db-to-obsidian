@Jabaluck @btshapir @paulnovosad @yudapearl I think even defining the counterfactuals of interest is missing on the literature (as far as I have read). For instance, the idea of the wage gap being "mostly due to" something is inherently about decomposing mechanisms, a case where traditional regression adjustment will fail.
