@yudapearl @danilobzdok @blei_lab @StatModeling Have the two of you discussed it in person? I am, quite honestly, surprised. I find both of you to generally be very precise. Maybe it is the issue that you two use different language? Could you give an example of a paper of @statmodeling where you would disagree?
