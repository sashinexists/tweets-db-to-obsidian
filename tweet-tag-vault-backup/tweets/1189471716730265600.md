I actually called PS "ingenious". The only thing I "demolished" was the myth that it has anything to do with (asymptotic) "bias reduction". It is a powerful estimator, once you make sure that the covariates satisfy the back-door criterion. See  https://t.co/rJijk695lK #Bookofwhy https://t.co/ebd7Nt6tcQ
