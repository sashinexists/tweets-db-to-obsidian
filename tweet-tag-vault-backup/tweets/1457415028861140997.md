1/ Comments: (1) Any econ. class that starts with "causality" and "causal hierarchy" is bound to be on the right track. (2) The term NPSEM-IE is a misnomer, it should read SCM, or
“Nonparametric Structural Equation Model with SOME Independent Errors”, or Semi-Markovian SCM. (3) https://t.co/QwrRjGIiR6
