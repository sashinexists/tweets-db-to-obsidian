@aynumazi @yudapearl @AOC @deborahlipstadt @bellingcat No she's not a Buffalo conspiracist. But she's no honest broker. How do you sign leg that affirms Palestinian indigeneity (arguably justifiable-it's semantic) but then ignore so de facto deny ancient Jewish history in the region? It's a bit anti-Israel not pro human rights.
