@kareem_carr @yudapearl Agree. I loved working with Leo Breiman, I admire the work of @yudapearl yet for me the goal of ML is to model intelligent behaviour. Debates on symbolism vs connectionism, frequentist vs Bayesian, RL vs predictive, causal vs association, etc, are useful but often a distraction.
