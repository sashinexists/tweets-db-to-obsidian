@JohnAntonakis @metrics52 @angrist_noam Let's get to the substance of it. Can you take a quick look at the examples discussed in the paper https://t.co/tJ4ecEo7fC and report back whether or not they add an important new dimension to the "causal science" as you know it, the one that was nailed long time ago.
