@EpiEllie @AndrewJDBell I appreciate the underlying research question isn't causal. And so the result may be helpful for diagnosis w/in its specific time &amp; space. However, since we don't understand the underlying DGP, I struggle thinking abt generalizability (across time or space). What's your take?
