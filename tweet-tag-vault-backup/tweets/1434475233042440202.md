@yudapearl @JaapAbbring @Chris_Auld @PhilHaile @VC31415 @DonskerClass @steventberry @yudapearl, you appear to be claiming parametric restrictions cannot be scientifically plausible. It would be better to argue that existing SCM theory does apply but is incomplete: we need theorems that extend SCM identification theory to incorporate plausible shape restrictions.
