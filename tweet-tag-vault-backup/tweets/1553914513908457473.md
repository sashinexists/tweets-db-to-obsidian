@ramespaulus @IfNotNowOrg I'm going to ask @Twitter for reinstatement, present my Jewish credentials, and pretend I am a Jew of Discomfort. I can even put on an Arafat Yarmulka, chant Havdalah at noon like an idiot. As long as they don't ask me to support Rep. Andy Levin -- I cannot betray my people.
