@statsepi @yudapearl @ADAlthousePhD @stephensenn @f2harrell @soboleffspaces @SMuellerLab I think that what may look like 'professional pride' is perhaps a belief that 'these things are not needed, because I don't need them / find them helpful'. We all probably believe our own approach is more helpful &amp; others are less. Eg I am very pro-DAGs because they help me.
