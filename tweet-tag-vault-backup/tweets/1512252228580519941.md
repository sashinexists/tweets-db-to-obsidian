In times like that, it is appropriate I believe to list the popular bands and pop stars and social media influencers, whose silence emboldens the next terror attack. I'm not into pop stars, so I would start my list with @amnesty, @HRW, Linda Sarsour, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar. https://t.co/KSqIhKDApc
