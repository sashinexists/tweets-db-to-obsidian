@FabItMart @causalinf This is precisely what #Bookofwhy does. It starts with the Garden of Eden, and goes to great pain of explaining the difference between "having interest in causation" and "mathematizing causation". What are you (and others) objecting to? Eden? The Garden? or the mathematization?
