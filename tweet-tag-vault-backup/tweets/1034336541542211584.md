@HolgerSteinmetz @PHuenermund @Noahpinion This paper has nothing to do with causation. They talk about "effect size" (as do many wishful) but if you replace "effect size" with "regression-coefficient size" every sentence will still be valid. My litmus test is notation: Diagram?, do(x) or Y(x) ? else it's pre-causal
