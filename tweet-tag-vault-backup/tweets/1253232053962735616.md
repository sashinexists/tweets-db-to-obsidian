@autoregress @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @Jabaluck @HeerJeet Every setting that you would be willing to call "real-world" can be solved by these problems, or through the general theorems that these problems illustrate, or labeled "unsolvable" by the completeness theorems that follow (in later papers)."Real-world" boasting is a red herring.
