@EpiEllie @eliasbareinboim @iwashyna @eddericu @Amy_Bohnert @Research_ICU @NEJM @_MiguelHernan I am not familiar with any causal effect or estimand of causal effect that is not "ideal" in the same sense, namely, it is what RCT is trying to emulate. So, I do not understand the point of introducing a new adjective into the crowded glossary of causal vocabulary. #Bookofwhy
