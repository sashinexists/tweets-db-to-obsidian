@PavlosMsaouel @stephensenn @ESteyerberg @LinkedIn @Lester_Domes @MariaGlymour @NP_Jewell @XiaoLiMeng1 It is not a matter of choosing focus. Lord defined his dilemma clearly and we have to help him resolve it, even if our favorite occupation is to estimate variances and design blocks and clusters. Lord's story has no "design" and the dilemma concerns bias, not variance.
