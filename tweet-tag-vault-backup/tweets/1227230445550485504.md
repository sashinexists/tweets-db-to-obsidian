Warning! Good paper, but I would not recommend expressions like:
"A DAG is one method that investigators may use to clarify
which variables have causal interpretations in statistical
models."1st, NO method can clarify that. 2nd, DAGs are causal, not statistical models. #Bookofwhy https://t.co/W9OhqmgQw2
