@iwashyna @EpiEllie @yudapearl @eddericu @Amy_Bohnert @Research_ICU @NEJM @_MiguelHernan Thanks, but the wording is though to me - "conceptual approach to causal inference". Can you translate to some more specific terms &amp; perhaps list the differences bt target trials &amp; standard RCTs? If not, @EpiEllie is always able to help, she speaks causal language! :)
