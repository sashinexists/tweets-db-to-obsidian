@NoahHaber @economeager @statsepi @Emma_C_Clarke @NoahHaber, I overlooked your thoughtful thread on the comparison of epi to econ. Allow me to reiterate another element: Epi use DAGs because "DAGs go to where knowledge resides". Econ. do not use DAGs because it is culturally prudent to do things in your head. #Bookofwhy
