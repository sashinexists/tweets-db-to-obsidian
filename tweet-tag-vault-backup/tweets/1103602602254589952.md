@iamconscious2 @RebekahBaglini I wish I could be there. But, seriously, is anyone doubting that we are having a causal revolution? I have an untested theory in mind: Those who doubt do not know how to solve Simpson paradox (or any toy problem), and those who do not doubt can solve it. Worth a test. #Bookofwhy
