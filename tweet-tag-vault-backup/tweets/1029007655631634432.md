@EpiEllie @l__ds @malco_barrett @NeuroStats @ken_rothman I used to think the way you do. But consider these three pies:
(A=1,C=0) (B=1,C=1) (A=0, C=1)
A and B do not interact. Now consider:
(A=1,B=0, C=0) (A=1, B=1) (A=0, B=0, C=1)
Here A and B do interact, right?
Alas, the two are logically equivalent. #Bookofwhy #causalinference
