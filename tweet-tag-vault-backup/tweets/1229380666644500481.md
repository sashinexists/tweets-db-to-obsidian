Good point. We should really make clear it's not "probabilistic models" but "models of reality", as opposed to models of data. I hate to say "causal models", b/c ML folks would say "It must be awfully complicated". "Reality" on the other hand is supposed to be simple. #Bookofwhy https://t.co/1vZeNucLPA
