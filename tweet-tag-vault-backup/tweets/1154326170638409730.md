@Jabaluck @yudapearl @PHuenermund @fuzzydunlop123 But age isn't the only thing that influences mortality. Poorer people are more likely to loose health care bc they can't make a payment. Less educated or "irresponsible" people bc they forgot one. All of these factors (+ many others) may correlate with mortality.
