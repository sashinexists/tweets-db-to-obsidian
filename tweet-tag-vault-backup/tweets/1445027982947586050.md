@stephensenn @yudapearl @NP_Jewell Epidemiologists might point at bias in design 1 (residual confounding); statisticians might draw attention to variance estimation (a cluster RCT with 2 clusters has essentially 2 observations)

Causal experts, what do you say? No problem, since contrast of interest identical?
