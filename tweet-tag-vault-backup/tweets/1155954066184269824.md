Good news for causality research! Congratulations to Elias and co-authors for best paper award at the UAI-2019 conference, straight from Tel-Aviv marina, where I got my wind-surfing diploma in 1980 (framed in my office). They told me creative surfing is the secret to success. https://t.co/g0mct9W5cu
