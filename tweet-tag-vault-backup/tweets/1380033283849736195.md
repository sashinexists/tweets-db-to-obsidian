Many readers try to get counterfactuals from Causal BN, but it is impossible. 
Let's examine this one X---&gt;Y. It gives us P(x,y) and P(y|do(x)) and P(x|do(y)). Now, try to compute the counterfactual PN = P(Y(X=1)=1| X=0, Y=0)
See Causality p. 35-36 and https://t.co/ZhBuNWD0Cw https://t.co/DVERifWWo9
