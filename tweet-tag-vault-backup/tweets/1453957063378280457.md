@yudapearl @epistwatchtower @PHuenermund @holdmytowel I was not reacting to your letter to Cartwright, which was reasonable, if a bit polemical.

I was reacting (I think reasonably, but I’ll accept the verdict of history) to your tweet.

I’d venture to claim that my reply was exactly as fair and productive as your tweet.
