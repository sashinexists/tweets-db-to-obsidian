Dear @yudapearl, I am reading your 2015 paper: https://t.co/Dl2L3RLIrD I have a hard time understanding why Y_x still depends on S, given Z?  This seems not supported by d-separation rules. For “natural dependence of salary on training”, should there be a path from S to Y? Thx! https://t.co/VysiWeqDqX
