@UnSethled @Nomad_Olive @blakeflayton @MairavZ @InnaVernikov @SAFECUNY @EinatWilf @Eve_Barlow @bariweiss @newzionists @zioness_lioness I don't believe you are lol. Most likely you are expressing discomfort facing a mirror after years of basking in a bubble of self-righteousness. The next step is to vilify others as "terrorists", "shameful" and other populist slogans. The next is another look at the mirror.
