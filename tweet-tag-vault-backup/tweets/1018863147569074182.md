@yudapearl @RandomlyWalking @eliasbareinboim That would be to conclude that data were not needed.  You can detect that long before asymptopia and the prediction is as good as one can get (esp. if prior was group-elicited).  Asymptotics still irrelevant as I'm not at the large n stage and neither are decision makers IMHO.
