@yudapearl @causalinf @Chris_Auld @lewbel @PHuenermund @econbookclub @analisereal @jdramirezc @PhilHaile In general, the same as yours. The correct one! Heckman went through this with you long ago. @Chris_Auld makes the good point, though, that "equilibrium" is not the same as "cyclic" &amp; that opens up particular counterfactuals ("the slope of demand")  that are otherwise confusing.
