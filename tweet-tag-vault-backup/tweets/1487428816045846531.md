@yudapearl @jeremycorbyn He isn't anti Israel. He has criticisms of Israel, he has far greater criticisms of the UK, many criticisms of the US &amp; has had many criticisms of the EU. That you see criticism of Israel as being anti Israel is your mistake. Nothing is perfect, criticisms are about improvement
