@KordingLab @Raamana_ @andpru If everything is connected to everything else you cannot get any causal conclusions. Even in elementary IV, you need exogeneity (of Z) and exclusion. Each implies some missing arrows. In RDD we have equality constraints. The need increases when we deviate from ideal models.
