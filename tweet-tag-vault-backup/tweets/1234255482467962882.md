@manuel_vlrd @nntaleb I like the way you put it: "formalize the intuition that you take for granted". But I dont foresee "a big blunder" for those who resign to taking certain intuitions for granted. The only problem might be repeating analyses on intuitions that come from the same source. #Bookofwhy
