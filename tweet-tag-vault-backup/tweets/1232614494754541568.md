@yudapearl @ylecun @NoelSharkey @GaryMarcus Thanks! Also the work of Jose Pena compliments it. One last question @yudapearl: is there now a solution  to handle continuous functions in feedback loops in causal models? Or some fine discretization is still needed to simulate processes like in @ylecun example?
