@yudapearl @Jabaluck @gelbach @HeerJeet 2. More simply, many models we are interested in (e.g. classic supply and demand) are not "directed" and thus not suitably represented by a DAG (afaik). Non-parametric shape restrictions like LATE monotonicity are similarly hard to see graphically (afaik). Not so for PO's.
