Speaking of "fairness", here is a "fair" request made by my Rabbi @RabbiLindaGold1:
The Mayor of every US city should make sure the quality of weapons in the hands of the mafia equals that given to the police.
We must "create some parity", said the Rabbi, "It's truly a disgrace". https://t.co/iNYr7vtyGe
