@jasonhartford @dustinvtran @zacharylipton @CsabaSzepesvari @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @yudapearl @ShalitUri 1/5 Well, as you know, most of my work does use Fisherian random, so it's not a matter of ruling it out. It's important to make clear to newcomers that when we sample from P(.|do(X)) and want to make a claim about E[.|do(X)], scientifically speak., it's a well-understood problem.
