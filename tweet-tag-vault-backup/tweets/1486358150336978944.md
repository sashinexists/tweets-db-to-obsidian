@AsraNomani @fcpsnews @Harvard @yudapearl Neither does the presence of blacks. But here's the data:
UCLA 33% Asian
Berkeley 30%
Stanford 28%
Harvard 26%
Princeton 21%
Penn 16%
Cornell 16%
Yale 15%
Chicago 14%
Columbia 12%
So, you can say they ALL discriminate against Asians but Harvard is a lot better than most of them.
