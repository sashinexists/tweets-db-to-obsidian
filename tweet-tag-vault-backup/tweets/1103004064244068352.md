@omaclaren @BreskinEpi How is this different from, say, you have n = 2 and thus almost nothing can be reliably estimated? What I'm trying to say is that the problem you seem to be raising does not require invoking identification at all, you would be facing this problem to estimate E[Y|x] for instance.
