@instrumenthull @soboleffspaces @jmwooldridge @causalinf @Nichogachet @pedrohcgs @lewbel @BruceEHansen Good question! Y^x is defined in terms of SEM, which every economist learn in Econ 101. "Potential outcomes" however are defined (by Rubin) in terms of "treatment" and "assignment" which do not exist in classical economics. So, Y^x is NOT exactly PO, the former is well defined.
