@malco_barrett @NeuroStats @l__ds @ken_rothman @EpiEllie Is it justified to call the slices of the PIE "sufficient causes" ? 
Consider the famous oxygen-match-fire problem:
Was the Presence of Oxygen a sufficient cause for the fire?.
More trouble: The DNF is not unique. If A is a sufficient cause, so is any
event B=1. Why? see 2/3
