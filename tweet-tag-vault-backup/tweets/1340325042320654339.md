@vkatikireddi @mendel_random @michyshim @epi_kerrykeyes The only way to annoy me is to misrepresent DAGs and SCM. Plowing through your paper, my annoyance level is way below the one described in https://t.co/HQWctOvt9Y. And I am glad that, with the exception of analogical reasoning, you find DAGs capable of capturing Hill's intuition.
