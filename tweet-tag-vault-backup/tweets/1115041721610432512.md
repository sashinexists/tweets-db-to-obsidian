A tiny comment on "repackaging of things we know". What exactly do we "KNOW" that #Bookofwhy has "repackage"? We KNOW the rules of chess. These rules dictate which board position is a WIN for white. Do we KNOW which board position is a WIN for white?" Care to explain 'repackage'? https://t.co/5huNEsTJeD
