I was 13 when the first wave of Yemenite Jews arrived at Israel, and I soon got engaged in a campaign to collect toys from the well-fed kids of Tel-Aviv -- as welcome gifts for the Yemenite children who haven't seen a toy before. Trucks full of toys arrived at the tent sites. 1/2 https://t.co/jvcSlnLBWa
