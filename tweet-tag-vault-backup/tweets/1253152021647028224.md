@Jabaluck @gelbach @autoregress @HeerJeet Now you are generalizing. I never insist on "my work", this is your hang up. I insist only on starting with cognitively meaningful and defensible encoding of what we know, combining it with data, and formally deriving what we wish to know. Has any of your model papers done that?
