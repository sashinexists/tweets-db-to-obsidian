@MeganTStevenson @PHuenermund @paulgp @dlmillimet @pietrobiroli @yudapearl @eliasbareinboim Now I agree the task becomes harder when dealing with human decision-makers, because we can't say they follow such a known algorithm. Still, there are def some people who are self-proclaimed racists that would change a decision from self-reported race
