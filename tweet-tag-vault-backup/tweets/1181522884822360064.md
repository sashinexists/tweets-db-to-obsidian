An extremely valuable article on the influence of Wikipedia on science. Thanks. A possible bias: I often use Wikipedia to find citations to articles that I do not want to read.  Sometimes to pacify a reviewer and sometimes to tell readers: "it's there, don't bother" #Bookofwhy https://t.co/1csYlFy7om
