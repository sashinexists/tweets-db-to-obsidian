@IvanWerning @steventberry @PHuenermund @Jacobb_Douglas @yudapearl @MariaGlymour @autoregress A context in which "reduced form" is used all the time in empirical work is to refer to a regression of Y on an instrument Z as opposed to say a 2SLS estimate of the impact of X on Y. I think this is a special case of Phil's def'n in a structural model where Z is exogenous.
