@eliasbareinboim @dustinvtran @zacharylipton @CsabaSzepesvari @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @yudapearl @ShalitUri I sympathize with the desire to limit the scope of terminology (e.g. "inference" now means different things in different communities!) - but ruling out random assignment amounts to claiming that early approaches to inferring causal effects (RCTs) weren't doing "causal inference".
