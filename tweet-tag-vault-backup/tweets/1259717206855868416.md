@yudapearl @hyperplanes @dade_us Sorry -  I keep writing submission when I mean publishing. My bad; I've deleted that once already.  I'm saying just for clarity that at JCI, if you have a paper accepted, and you say you are unwilling to pay the grand, that fee will be waived?  Apologies I wasn't clear.
