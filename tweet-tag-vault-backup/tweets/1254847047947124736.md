@AlexChinco @amt_shrma @analisereal @maximananyev @Jabaluck @eliasbareinboim @yudapearl @PACESconsulting @gelbach @guilhermejd1 @HeerJeet Thanks! I agree that the phone outage example is a good one (similar to an ex involving labor market hiring + criminal background measurement error here: https://t.co/r4eLNlXhoc) Still strikes me as different than the seating example, but perhaps it's not so different after all
