@stevesphd @eliasbareinboim @mendel_random @jwbelmon Thanks for correcting me. I did not have an explanation why Imbens could not solve the 4 toy problems, so I blamed textbooks. The real reason is linguistic; asserting conditional exogeneity in the language of ignorability does not give us a clue whether it holds in a toy problem.
