@yudapearl @eliasbareinboim @jasonhartford @dustinvtran @zacharylipton @CsabaSzepesvari @GaryMarcus @earnmyturns @ShalitUri I thought that the whole point of causal models was to evaluate the outcome of simulated actions using the model without actually executing them as done in RL. So it is possible to do causal inference without simulation?
