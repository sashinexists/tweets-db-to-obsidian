@AdanZBecerra1 @jon_y_huang @WATZILEI @ecpolley I understand that "double robustness" provides protection against misspecification in your model. Thus, naturally, your model (ie DAG) needs to be consulted before deciding if protection is needed and, if so, what protection would be adequate. #Bookofwhy
