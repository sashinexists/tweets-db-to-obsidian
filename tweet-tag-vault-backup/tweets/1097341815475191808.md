@zarzuelazen @Grady_Booch I wish I could resonate with your architecture, but seeing "Information Theory" next to "Action" my antenna rises: Information theory is purely probabilistic, how can it govern Action ? It does not sit. Note: #Bookofwhy does not mention entropy, or Shannon's mutual information.
