@RepAOC represents the knowledge and mentality of most people I met who use the word "occupation". What they're trying to say is: "I must say something nasty about Israel, I know that "apartheid" and "ethnic cleansing" are idiotic allegations; "occupation" sounds factual &amp; ugly". https://t.co/fvLMYoI8zQ
