@AiSimonThompson @kareem_carr There is a difference between "accounting for maladies" and "overcoming maladies". Theory can only tell you whether an "accounted for" malady can be overcome, and how. Moreover, it also tells us that no one can do better, including those who refuse to "account for" maladies.
