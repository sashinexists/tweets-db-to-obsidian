@yudapearl @noah_greifer @soboleffspaces @causalinf @EpiEllie @bveg3 @Lizstuartdc Does the definition of the ICE in the latter paper implicitly assume that the counterfactual, Y(x, u), is deterministic given the individual u and the decisions x? Is the “fundamental problem” to simplistic, ignoring that Y(x, u) could change if the experiment could be repeated?
