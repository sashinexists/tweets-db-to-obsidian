@guilhermejd1 @deaneckles @PHuenermund @AndersHuitfeldt @yudapearl To be clear since this point may be overlooked by some here. The DAG is an encoder of the structural constraints in its non-parametric form (less committal), but can also encode parametric ones (e.g., linearity), as shown by Sewall Wright; for a survey, see [Ch. 5Â Pearl, 2000].
