@stephensenn @RonKenett @learnfromerror It is hard for me to believe that this intuition was made formal before 1975. Why? Because "determinant" is a causal notion, and statistics did not have the notation to distinguish a "determinant" from its proxies; the latter could be bad blocks. Thus my disbelief. #Bookofwhy
