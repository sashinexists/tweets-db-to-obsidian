I wish I could join @seanjtaylor in recommending @matheusfacure's book, but I can't find the First Law of Causal Inference in it (https://t.co/etASSEk4Or), so how can I? 
As to @CasualBrady's notes, the chapter on counterfactuals is still in the making; it has great potential. https://t.co/fPf18loXnX
