@sweichwald @GunnarBlohm @KordingLab @dan_marinazzo Causal â‰  "interpreting effects of interventions"... A causal model has causal parameters (as opposed to, say, a statistical model). A causal inference is a specific inference drawn from an observed dynamic system. DCM in theory supports the latter imo, not so much in practice ðŸ™‚
