Jeff has a point. If we start with "colliders" and "confounders" economists can say: "yes that makes sense but I didn't need a DAG to understand that." For this reason I usually start with "look at your own model, the one you authored. Can you tell me a few things about it?" https://t.co/pI5LSuTkfK
