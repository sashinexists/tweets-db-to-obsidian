@NeuroStats @analisereal Thanks Manjari for posting this paper. We should have mentioned Tukey in #Bookofwhy as a singularity (among statisticians) who stated publically that causation is NOT a species of correlation and that statistics can learn something from an outsider. Any link to the whole paper?
