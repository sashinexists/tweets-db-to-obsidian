@AdanZBecerra1 @yudapearl @PHuenermund @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal I don't think you're not estimating the causal effect of race ever -- that's a different question (more akin to what I posed originally). You're estimating the causal effect of increasing treatment for minorities.
