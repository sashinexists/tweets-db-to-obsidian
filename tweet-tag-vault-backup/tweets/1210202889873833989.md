@guillefix @maier_ak @hardmaru @ngutten @jsusskin @LeCun @thomaskipf What is not available to DL training is not "data"
but "information" on how to get the appropriate data. For example, that "age" is a confounder, hence, estimate the age-specific effects, not aggregate effects. See Simpson's paradox, #Bookofwhy p.211, or https://t.co/GpSKmVcKR7
