@Jabaluck @fuzzydunlop123 @autoregress @MariaGlymour @PHuenermund @EpiEllie @causalinf @EpiDancer @metrics52 3/ ONLY huge "real life" problems, not "toy problems" which have ground truth and where everyone can see if you solved it correctly or not. Such problems are avoided like a plague, labeled "toy", "made-up" and worse, but never discussed in good company. I said "it sounds funny"
