@RemyLevin @HeerJeet @guacamolebio @beyerstein I am not familiar with a lot of cross-disciplinary critiques, except the ones I have articulated here https://t.co/Jf1SkgV3CK and here #Bookofwhy. Speaking of these critiques, I see concrete examples, formal proofs and powerful tools - not one shred of dishonesty or X-measuring!
