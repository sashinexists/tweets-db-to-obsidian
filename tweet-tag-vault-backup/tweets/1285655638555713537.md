Wonderful post about missingness-graphs, agree! How come we missed it thus far? Does it means missing-data folks are beginning to ask WHY, like the rest of us, and demand to understand what their assumptions mean, and what can be recovered from missing data? End to hopelessness! https://t.co/J9eRNiei5z
