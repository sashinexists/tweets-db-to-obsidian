@RonKenett @stephensenn @learnfromerror Funny. I have heard the phrase " one of the important areas of statistics" reiterated since 1975, about causality. And I now understand that it meant: "Sorry, statistics does not have the tools to handle it." Nowadays, with new tools, I hope to capture your intuition. #Bookofwhy
