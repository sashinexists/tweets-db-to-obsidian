@robertwplatt @analisereal @PWGTennant @UrbanHealthProf @mendel_random @IJEeditorial Good point. Popular culture has it that the appropriate outcome of an epi study is "better treatments". But the logic of CI tells us that an observational study can only aim at "best treatment under the assumptions". Therefore, "scrutinizable assumptions" =&gt; "better treatment".
