Thanks for posting, @DKedmey. I didn't know this interview with Marvin Minsky exists; it's full of great ideas, some new to me. I had one serious conversation with Marvin in 2011, on free will. He was astonished that anyone takes free will seriously in the age of computers... https://t.co/VFj7Ph3FJL
