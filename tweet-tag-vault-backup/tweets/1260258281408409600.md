@yudapearl @KetchupEconomi1 @sterndavidi Editor salaries vary widely. I heard AEA editors (incl AEJ) make six figures, but that falls like a rock beyond that level. Referees are sometimes paid (for AEA journals) but only if deadlines are met and thatâ€™s not currently the modal practice unfortunately.
