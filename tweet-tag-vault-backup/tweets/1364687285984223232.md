Students of causality will find challenge in this variant:
           Z
           |
           v
X----&gt;M----&gt;Y
Is it good or bad to control for Z to estimate P(y|do(x))?  
Z seems to be an "effect modifier" b/c it "clamps down" M, which is a mediator between X and Y. But is it? https://t.co/7CqcPrZVE1
