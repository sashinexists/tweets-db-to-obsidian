@PHuenermund @dlmillimet @snavarrol @yudapearl @a40ruhr @causalinf @PossebomVitor @nickchk No, I'm literally quoting from @yudapearl's earlier post. I'm not "making up strawmen". But in any case, the above quote is hopelessly vague. Either @yudapearl is endorsing everything Angrist, Card, Krueger etc... say we should do in addition to DAGs, in which case he is wrong
