Your review is excellent and comprehensive. Now that we dig the limitations of classic IV's, attention should perhaps be shifted to "mediating IV's" (frontdoor) which provide nonparametric point identification of ATE and ATT (#bookofwhy, p. 235-7), albeit under different setting. https://t.co/6lm4a4cLjY
