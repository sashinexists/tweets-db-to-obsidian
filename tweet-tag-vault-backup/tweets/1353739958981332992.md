@kareem_carr, would you say a paradox is OVER-HYPED if it provides evidence that human intuition is governed by the logic of causation, as opposed to some other logics?? This is what we learn from "paradoxes" such as MH, Simpson &amp; Lord -- an UNDER-APPRECIATED conclusion! https://t.co/VslvQb78OQ
