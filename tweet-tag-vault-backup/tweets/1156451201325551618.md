@TariqTaha123 @CNNSotu @jaketapper My father was one of those Jews who came peacefully to his historical homeland. He was not silenced at all, I was there. He actually offered our Arab neighbors peaceful co-existence. Do you know what answer he got? I hate to embarrass you in public but, beware, I was there!
