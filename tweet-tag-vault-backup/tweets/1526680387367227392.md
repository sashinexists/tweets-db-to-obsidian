@adamalmo @blakeflayton It was politically useful for Shabtai Zvi too, since his followers were all Jews. But the Rabbis of Constantinople decided (1650) Enough is Enough &amp; excommunicated him. Our Rabbis don't have the guts nor authority. Shabtai got the mesg and converted to Islam. Will @PeterBeinart?
