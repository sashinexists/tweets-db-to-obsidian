@Jabaluck @yudapearl @PHuenermund @pierre_azoulay @causalinf @autoregress @analisereal In a complex observational study, you assume away lots of things, regardless of what approach. It is what it is.I cant find a more transparent way to make assumptions explicit than DAGs.Without making assumptions explicit, researchers often dont even know what they are assuming.
