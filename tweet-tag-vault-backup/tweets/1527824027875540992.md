That's a good point. I've read dozens of articles on how conspiracy theories endanger lives, democracy and our sense of right and wrong.
No one has called out @AOC for fueling such theories when it comes to Israel, not even @deborahlipstadt on NPR. Is @AOC not a Buffalo enabler? https://t.co/ngBQNDneom
