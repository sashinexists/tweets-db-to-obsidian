Sister Linda, Sister Linda. I don't know much about antisemitism, but I can assure you that Zionophobia is very much systemic in my University. Some Zionophobes are so systemic, they even said: "You can't be a Feminist if you are a Zionist", remember? https://t.co/2nCKQxaZHX https://t.co/QLFwbmLTp5
