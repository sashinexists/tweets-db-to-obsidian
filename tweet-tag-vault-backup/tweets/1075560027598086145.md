@jon_y_huang @yudapearl If an exposure has a well-defined intervention then it will meet consistency assumption; if it doesnâ€™t, it likely fails not only consistency but also exchangeability. The key aspect is not really manipulability so much as whether the ways exposure can happen are equivalent.
