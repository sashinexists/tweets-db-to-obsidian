The siren sound that I hear from Israel today has the same pitch as the one I heard in 1948, when Egyptian war planes bombed Tel Aviv. But then, people did not say "Israel has a right to defend", it was self evident. Today, a nation must beg public opinion for the right to live. https://t.co/D3TwkRwbJM
