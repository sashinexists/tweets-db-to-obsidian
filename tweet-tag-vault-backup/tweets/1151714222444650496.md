@djvanness @yudapearl @ConiByera @AndersHuitfeldt This doesn’t seem like a necessary reading to me, but something you’re grafting onto the DAG framework. Eg could be U := X + Z, Y := U. No interaction. Again, I think DAGs simply can’t/don’t express the concept of interaction or anything about the type of functional dependencies
