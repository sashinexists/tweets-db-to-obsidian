I thought it was a dream: "demanding Iraqi Jews to come back "home"'. I rushed to show it to my wife, who was expelled from Iraq in 1950, to Israel. Her answer: These people will never understand what "home" is; we never felt "at home" in Iraq, though we stayed there 2,536 yrs. https://t.co/Iyg8mrTSGf
