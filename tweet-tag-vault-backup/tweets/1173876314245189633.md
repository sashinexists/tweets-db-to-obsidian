@strangecosmos @GaryMarcus @ylecun If by "ML techniques" you mean any future algorithm, then you are justified in saying "I dont know". But if by "ML techniques" you mean algorithms based on data only, we can tell even today that the answer is NO. We can't compute 3-dim volume from a 2-dim shadow. #Bookofwhy
