@PHuenermund @VC31415 @jermainkaminski Agree with Paul. Simpson's paradox is the best way of introducing causality (and DAGs) to students, because its resolution rests on causal structure, ie DAGs. The Google example is striking, but students yawn over numerical examples. I prefer qualitative ways, scatter diagrams.
