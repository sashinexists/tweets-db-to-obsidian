I'm pretty sure a lot of this variation is driven by networks. DAGs are so popular in epi, e.g., because Jamie Robins was an early enthusiast and his Harvard group was extremely influential. Totally different story in econ where there was a lot of early pushback from big shots. https://t.co/QBnH50x8T2
