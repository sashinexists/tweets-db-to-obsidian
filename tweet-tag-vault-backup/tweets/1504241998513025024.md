@yudapearl @stephensenn @soboleffspaces @JFronczekMD @EpiEllie @f2harrell @ADAlthousePhD @artistexyz @statsepi @GuyattGH @GRADE_WG In the female obs study, disease mortality on no drug was again 180/600=30% so from the RCT, the expected mortality on drug was 30-28=2%. However the actual mortality on drug was 73% suggesting deaths from adverse drug effect was 73-2=71% by not avoiding fatal contraindications.
