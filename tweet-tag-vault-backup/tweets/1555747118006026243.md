@MeganTStevenson @PHuenermund @paulgp @dlmillimet @pietrobiroli @yudapearl @eliasbareinboim Just like how in an audit/correspondence study we isolate a single factor -- like skin color in Doleac/Stein

I agree "race" is a construct of many correlated factors. I guess I dont see what we can't think of illegal discrimination on the basis of those factors (like skin color)
