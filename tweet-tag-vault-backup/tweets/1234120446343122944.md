It is fascinating to watch how traditional probabilists handle puzzles that emerge from causal reasoning (in this case the collider structure) lacking a language to capture causal relations. How do we tell them about the causal language w/o offending them? @nntaleb #Bookofwhy https://t.co/kehdPaRSOS
