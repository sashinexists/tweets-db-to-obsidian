@DKedmey @EVKontorovich We do not expect universities to "thwart" Zionophobia, or to police any speech on campus. We expect them, however, to treat Zionophobia the same way they treat Islamophobia or white supremacy, namely, as morally disgusting, albeit protected, ideologies: https://t.co/7jn0pnLspP
