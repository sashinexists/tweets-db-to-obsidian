@SamuelW09371956 @fuiud @PHuenermund @Jabaluck Correct, I do not do empirical work in the narrow sense of conducting RCT's on drugs or in developing countries. But your IMO misses the point that a theory in which key aspects of empirical work are represented is worth 1,000 RCT's that are blind to those aspects. #Bookofwhy
