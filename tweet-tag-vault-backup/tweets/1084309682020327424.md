@omaclaren @statwonk @yudapearl @PHuenermund Would it be unfair to say that Oliver does not accept as a valid the data analysis problem I raised, i.e., problems when the investigator does not know the true structural causal model {f_S, f_T, f_C and P(G, U)}? I want to double check since it seems a very strong statement.
