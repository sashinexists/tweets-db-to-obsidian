@f2harrell @yudapearl Sure u don't want to 'give up' on stats itself. Not saying anything polemic, just following Laplace, Poison,Dirichlet.. Any stats exercise starts from a CLT guarantee &amp; moves towards a relaxation. If it doesn't work under inf. samples, it shouldn't deserve the label "scientific".
