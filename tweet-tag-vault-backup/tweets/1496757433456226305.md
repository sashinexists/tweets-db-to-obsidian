@AndersHuitfeldt @AndrewPGrieve @suiss70 @miquelporta The point of our paper https://t.co/rGHIc9kH0O is that even RCT-based NNT does not capture the verbal definition "The average number of patients who need to be treated to prevent one additional bad outcome" (Wiki). "Prevent" means to flip an otherwise bad outcome into a good one.
