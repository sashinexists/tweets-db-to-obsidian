@thosjleeper @PHuenermund @dlmillimet @paulgp @PEngzell @patrickaturley No surprise that this is how IV is (still) taught in econ. They are talking about "structural equations" and call it "regression" and the variables "regressors". It is OK, as long as: (1) Econ. students can endure the confusion, and (2) a Glossary is in the making.#Bookofwhy
