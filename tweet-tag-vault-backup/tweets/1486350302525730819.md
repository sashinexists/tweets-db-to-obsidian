@AsraNomani @fcpsnews @Harvard class of 2025 is 26% Asian American, 28% Black &amp; Hispanic. That's been consistent for a few yr &amp; Asian % MUCH higher than Yale, Princeton or Columbia. Harvard won case in US district &amp; appeals court, with detailed decisions. Harvard does NOT discriminate against Asians.
