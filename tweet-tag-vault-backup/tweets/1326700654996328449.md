Erekat will be remembered as the inventor of the "Netufian" narrative: “I am the proud son of the Netufians and the Canaanites. I’ve been there for 5,500 years before Joshua. ” Hence "Palestinians could never  recognize Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people." Logic-101. https://t.co/90LcgHhDGO
