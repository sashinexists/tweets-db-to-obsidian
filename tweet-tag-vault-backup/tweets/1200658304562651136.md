@yudapearl @Lester_Domes @EpiEllie @ConiByera @LucyStats @AlexaYakubovich @AnjaLeist @rohitpojha @AbbyCScience @_MiguelHernan @casualinfer Do the others argue that Y(x) is ultimately the goal but that they want Y(x) for at least two different x values rather than just one? Or is this about whether eg expectations are enough? (I agree they are not in gen! Eg as Sander mentioned the effect could be change in variance)
