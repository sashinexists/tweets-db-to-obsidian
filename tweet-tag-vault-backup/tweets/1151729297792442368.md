@omaclaren @djvanness @ConiByera @AndersHuitfeldt Easy! You write Y = OR(X,Z) or Y=AND(X,Z). This is how you express it if you think you can. If you can't commit to one function or another you just write Y=f(X,Z) and you let data decide. If your data must be taken in isolation, it is mathematical impossibility.#Bookofwhy
