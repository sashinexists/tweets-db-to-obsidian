@SamerAbdelnour @mszargar @AsraNomani When moral grounds are shifting we invoke "international law". Surely, no one is obligated to accept anyone's neighbor. But those who cry "oppressed" could strengthen their case by showing some commitment to a permanent peace, once oppression is ended, by agreement.
