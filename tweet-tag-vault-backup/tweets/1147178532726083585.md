@yudapearl @EpiEllie @causalinferenc @_MiguelHernan If it's possible to measure and consider the 'well defined intervention' I think this should generally be preferred. But in the many situations where that's not possible, I think we also have to be willing to consider the generic concept; albeit clearly more qualitatively.
