@yudapearl @JadePinkSameera @ShannonBrownlee @Lester_Domes @vamrhein @dailyzad @METRICStanford @learnfromerror @MariaGlymour @CMichaelGibson @PTetlock @stephensenn @hmkyale @f2harrell @_MiguelHernan I am amused that you took my question seriously! Now we have humor on top of sarcasm on top of tongue-in-cheek, which twitter is bad at. I was using crude SAT logic - EBM:Traditional Medicine = Causal Inference:Traditional stats. I propose a radical new medium: F2F.
