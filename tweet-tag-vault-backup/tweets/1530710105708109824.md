@brianstelter @yudapearl

@cnn coverage of Israel today

1. Relying on witnesses with a history of animus, CNN calls the death of Abu Akleh “targeted” excluding possibility of accident.

2. CNN refers to Iraq’s criminalization of normal ties to Israel but omits death as penalty. https://t.co/LzU5fR6lYU
