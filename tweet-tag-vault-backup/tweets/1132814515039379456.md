In the old days the FW dilemma was: "God can predict what you are going to do, how can he punish you for what you did?" Modernity replaced God with the equations of physics, messed with quantum uncertainties. Our problem is a robot which surely "has no FW", should we punish HIM? https://t.co/cOeu8Rhiev
