@Dr_Cuspy @tdietterich @MarcioMinicz I would hate to use the word "autonomously" in a definition, b/c it is hard to tell if a program does things by choice, agency, or by being programmed to do it. "Predicting consequences" is easier, we can just ask the program to predict, and test the answer against outcomes.
