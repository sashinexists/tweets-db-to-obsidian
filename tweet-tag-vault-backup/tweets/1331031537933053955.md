@yudapearl @anniefofani @AndrewPessin @EinatWilf I see the US as a political, not national, community. In fact, most countries are likewise multinational. Israel too: it contains a majority Jewish nation and a minority Arab one. Yes, I'm a Zionist for whom Israel is binational. Hopefully a future Palestine will be too.
