@JoshuaBernardNY @aynumazi @AOC @deborahlipstadt @bellingcat As much as I value your candid discussion, I believe you grossly underestimate the depth of @AOC animosity towards Israel and the imminent dangers of her demonization agenda. I will change my opinion if she once says:  "equally indigenous" or "I met an Israeli grandmother".
