@stephensenn @yudapearl @f2harrell @soboleffspaces isn't this the DAG that resolves the issue? observed (X) and unobserved (U) confounders will differ between RCTs and observational samples; in practice U is always non-empty so inferences from RCTs do not generalize to observational data without extra assumptions? @yudapearl https://t.co/mV8oIyBgfr
