@CasualBrady @Peninha_13 Agree. "can respond to" is as good. I happened to like anthropomorphic metaphors, which irritates statisticians, but they dig it better. "can respond to changes in" is also useful, unless you talk to a mathematician, for whom "non-trivial function of" is sufficient. #Bookofwhy
